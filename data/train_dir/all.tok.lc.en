" c-major pentatonic scale " it 's no good .
i can 't learn this .
it 's too hard for me .
fool !
but it 's better to learn the scale early .
fool !
you stupid bird !
i 'll show you !
don 't rush it , koyuki-kun .
it 's only been two months since you started playing the guitar .
but he already knows the scale ...
c 'mon , we need a change of pace .
let 's go swimming !
" lucille " -okay , here goes !
-watch the ball !
what ?
so please buy your own melon roll .
it 's the truth . i was called to the faculty office .
s-see you ...
hold it , tanaka !
yukio tanaka of grade 8b .
please go to the faculty office immediately .
i repeat ...
listen , tanaka-kun ...
i don 't think you 're taking your job as umbrella monitor seriously .
oh , no ...
daily life is a series of little jobs like this .
maybe i should put this in your student report ...
i 'm disappointed in you , tanaka-kun .
you may go .
wait , tanaka-kun !
what is this ? !
what happened ?
it 's nothing .
we were kidding around and tanabe-kun did a drop kick on me .
tanaka-kun ...
and naturally , i gave it back to him with a heel hold ! so it 's no big deal !
tanaka-kun ...
-did you catch that game ? -yeah !
that was awesome !
you look glum , koyuki !
maho !
yo !
maho , you sure eat a lot .
shut up .
i 'm hungry .
you 'll gain weight .
you can have my fries .
beck 's first live performance has been set !
r-really ?
how long is this going to continue ?
i 'll talk to him for you .
okay , i 'm going on deliveries , so make up for being late and work extra hard .
i 'm sorry !
and don 't forget to feed page .
i 'm off !
-he sure is strict . -yeah .
around strangers .
it 's okay , i 'll feed him .
-he 's ...
-you little- !
t-this is the last of it !
these aren 't company documents !
they 're saito-san 's personal treasure !
treasure ?
i mean , private collection .
collection ?
koyuki , how long have you been working here ?
-since the end of summer break .
i want to repair the guitar ryusuke-kun gave me .
i didn 't know ...
that 's why i don 't want to see ryusuke-kun until the guitar is fixed .
i understand .
so , how much do you get paid ?
oh , umm ... 430 yen an hour .
are you serious ? !
that 's crazy !
this new law sure is bad for the manufacturing industry .
-saito-sama , this way please .
thank you for waiting . rie-chan !
thank you for calling her .
-oh , it 's ken-ken ! -rie-rie !
-i missed you sooo much !
-me too !
what 's with the get-up ?
caught a cold or something ?
i 'm in disguise !
but how 'd you guess it was me ?
you stand out too much .
okay , it 's starting !
ryusuke-kun 's guitar ... are those bullet marks ? !
they 're real .
is that ...
that guitar has a name ... it 's lucille .
-sounds like a woman 's name .
it 's a guitar with a past ...
ryusuke got it in some dangerous place . but ...
it couldn 't possibly have happened while he was performing ? !
one , two !
typhoon 24 !
24-7 !
24 hours straight !
beck !
b-e-c-k !
we 're gonna rush at you !
we 're gonna send you flyin ' head-first !
lift up your heavy ass , now if you take off that stiff head you 'll feel totally loose
this crazy , crazy world
you just have to stage dive or die
mind blower , a shower of sweat run towards a new world , my life
those who seek it will be rewarded pass the hot shot , keep on coming , come on !
blow your mind
squeeze your sweat yeah
blow your mind squeeze your sweat
this ... is beck ...
koyuki-kun ...
there 's still more ? !
-the guitar 's fixed now . -huh ?
the one with the broken neck . i sent it out for repairs .
i-is that true ?
you want to patch things up with ryusuke , don 't you ?
saito-san !
now go , hurry !
okay !
koyuki-kun ... deduction for leaving early .
i think this 'll do .
if you notice something while playing it , just let me know .
now i can see ryusuke-kun !
hey , tanaka ...
hey , tanaka . lemme play that guitar .
what an awful sound ...
suits you perfectly !
hey , masaru .
forget it , rikiya-kun .
the sound is the pits .
you laughed just now , didn 't you ?
-don 't act innocent !
no , i thought that tune was " anarchy in heaven ... "
recently , the sex handles-
any complaints ?
didn 't think so .
it was a piece of junk anyway .
let 's go , masaru !
yeah .
-how about new burger ?
did you get it , koyuki-kun ?
yeah ...
oh , good !
it 's all fixed , then ?
actually , it 's been slow here at saito paper company , so getting the money to fix it was a bit hard .
but it was worth it to see you smiling again !
saito-san ...
oh , you 're welcome !
mom used to say , " from that day on , yukio was like someone possessed by the guitar , and played it every single day . "
you were great at the concert !
think so ? !
i just looove your vocals , chiba-kun !
we won 't miss your next live performance !
then i 'll put you on the guest list !
give me your names and numbers !
hey , ray !
i 've gotta talk to you !
what ?
what 're you mad about all of a sudden ? wow !
ryusuke-kun , you speak english !
that 's so cool ! yeah .
i lived in new york for a long time . so i 'm more used to english than japanese .
-that 's so cool ! -that 's so cool !
we 've got to go to new york , too !
-tell us where you used to live !
-yeah !
we wanna visit it !
-sure .
-yay !
those idiots !
i was looking for the ab machine i bought by mail order last night ... and i finally found it !
found what ?
look !
this is it ...
the l48 eddie gave to you !
then the one i gave to koyuki was ... that was a fake one you got at the guitar shop in queens !
which means ...
-ryusuke-kun ! -ryusuke-kun !
don 't get tetanus !
yukio !
telephone !
yukio !
yukio !
i called ryusuke too .
you 're joking , right ?
oh , speak of the devil .
sorry !
maho ... did you really explain it to him ?
i did !
idiot !
why am i running away ? !
oh , koyuki !
izumi-chan !
i spoke to ryusuke-kun on the phone yesterday and he said to say hi .
oh ... can you say hello from me , too ?
all 9th graders will report to the gym for curriculum guidance .
i repeat ...
-it 's almost graduation .
i 'll be lonely .
see you , koyuki !
" dear koyuki-kun , "
" i 've decided to stay here a bit longer , so please take care of page ! "
he 's extending his stay again !
southeast asia must have something that lures grown men ...
fool !
i haven 't played yet !
punk rockers hold their guitars low ...
awright !
cripes !
i 'd better go to sleep !
look ...
eiji ...
look at him ...
didn 't he make his band successful all by himself ?
we just do things our way .
umm ... ginger ale .
okay .
hey , koyuki !
why 'd you run away the other day ?
sorry !
koyuki ! let 's go up front !
let 's go concrete hell , human safari park escape
ape in the brain , mass brain-washing operation , no thank you
let 's walk together , step in step , and we 'll get stuck in the deep
-i-is this what rap is ?
-i-is this what rap is ? -we 're at the rebellious age , free as we go -huh ?
-we 're at the rebellious age , free as we go
this is no barrier , just what is important , nothing impure , just clear
no pressure at our pace

wow ! amazing !
-hey , look at that poster !
-i 'm gonna get a shot of it !
so this is where ryusuke-kun grew up ! isn 't it cool !

cuttlefish ... grilled matsutake mushrooms ... " next episode "

" next episode "
hello , i would like you to touch wood
do you know this expression ?
the easiest way to understand it is referring to the heatwave of 2003 we have well known , may be more in the countryside with agricultural production .
in 2003 this is my place that 's what grew and i did not harvested .
when we see this as a farmer one has the right to wonder about the future .
that 's why i brought you wood that i will distribute .
touching wood , i think it 's good
it makes you feel calm .
it 's nice and it smells good .
here 's a piece for each of you , if you want to distribute .
it 's cherry and plum .
there are probably few in paris .
pass it to the others and we will do a simple experiment
to show that these branches are the future of agriculture .
it seems crazy !
we hear of agriculture at the edge of the drama
and it is true that agriculture is on the brink and we are on the brink .
i 'll show you the same experience as i had .
you take the branch and you do like that .
it can be shaped like a circle very easily .
and what i experienced in 2003 , in 2004 i did not experienced .
because the flexibility of these small branches that are produced every year growing every day the forest makes them .
the best model for agriculture is the forest because the forest does not need humans .
agriculture has derived to the assistantship , to technology .
farmers who don 't understand ground anymore .
farmers have forgotten that the best model and pragmatism of life encourage us to watch the living .
from the living , the forest is the best example .
no human intervention no watering , no fertilizers , pesticides , fungicides it works alone .
when i discovered the flexibility of the small branch i wondered :
why the branches of large diameter break easily ?
whereas we can shape small branches as a circle that represent the virtuous circle of trees which produces branches in huge quantities .
i found on the internet an explanation of the forest and its soil .
we learn that leaves are attached to small branches it is not because they are fed up that they fall .
they restore 50 to 60 % of their content to the branches .
in this branch you are holding ,
there all the nutrients which allow buds in a few months to make new branches which contain branches for the following year .
trees restart their growth only with the content of the small branches .
on large diameter branches there are no such nutrients .
as you read this , you think you can already act individually and talk about it to friends and we will cut branches .
the more we are numerous and the more is the occasion to meet , to live well then we cut the branches , we gather them we make pile and grind it in a machine .
this is a technical operation , but not insurmountable .
in africa , we do it with a machete .
we spread it on the ground a layer of 3 to 5 cm , no more .
we realize that this is not prohibitive for a garden with this material which is hidden here .
i will open it later .
when it is placed on the ground in winter , spring we incorporate it .
you mean there is something about seasons ?
yes , indeed .
at the arrival of winter , the branches store nutrients .
it 's going nowhere but in the branches , only at that time .
in the spring , those elements are diffused again .
so we proceed to what is called incorporation .
after a few weeks the agricultural soil that was here mainly stones has become this .
60 to 90 days after application of a 3 cm thick layer .
here is the top and there underneath .
we see mycelium , the real mushroom .
the mycelium is our collaborator to do what nature does only with mushrooms food chain with the lignin molecule .
the lignin molecule is very energetic and here comes a complex food chain of the soil .
the cultivated agricultural land becomes a forest soil .
it is a copy / paste of forest soil / agricultural land .
it works surprisingly for this stony soil with the rcw to grow wheat
with yields almost higher than normal .
the surprise is enormous , because the trees grow too as well as vegetables .
there you are on limestone plateaus of quercy i invite you to my place .
i brought you bracnches from my place , but here it is .
zucchini grow in full sun .
no watering , just seedlings .
i plant the seeds in the ground and wait for it to grow .
this year , with 12 zucchinis , i picked up 190 kilos .
no watering , no phytosanitary treatment , no weed control .
it might looks like the garden of eden we put the seeds in the ground and harvest .
these are my productions .
unfeasible on the plateau .
when you say you are going to grow carrots on limestone plateaus everyone says it , agronomists , experts there are 30 to 40 % of stones ,
30 cm of soil , impossible .
no water , no fertilizer , no treatment .
yields are 160 to 170 % .
the amount of dry matter is 30 % extra .
which means that the plants have less water and are tastier they overcook less easily and preservation is much longer .
no evidence of disease , plague , aphids or pests
it seems magical .
no human intervention .
it is like facing the forest without human intervention .
is it still agriculture ?
is this a new concept ?
even in mali , burkina faso , togo , gestures are the same , the results are the same .
when small branches are grinded , we put a thin layer on the floor we see the same phenomenon .
mushrooms of a certain family will take nutrients triggers a food chain which induces life returning in soil .
i have not mentioned the name , but it is rcw
w for wood
r for ramial , branches you have in your hand a very special part of the tree bearing leaves , where photosynthesis happens .
energy from the sun , transformed by the leaves is stored in the branches
this concept bothers agronomy , the farming profession must be reinvented .
you imagine a farm with 20 to 30 % of forest area or wood .
it can occur without soil conditioner with 50 % less water at least and a yield of 160 to 170 % .
you do it every 4-5 years .
it is about sustainability
this concept affects many people but research has difficulties to take it in account .
this package , for those who want , we can share it because it works in the garden , in a flower pot , with a lemon tree or a plant that you like .
you put a layer of 3 to 5 cm thick and it works !
you will have the most beautiful fruits less watering needs and besides it 's beautiful , it smells good .
for those that want to smell and take some there is a characteristic smell of forest .
i invite you to share this meal with the ground .
note :
c of rcw stands for chipped
subtitle and translation :
this is a rocket stove .
rocket stoves generally create much more efficient combustion and are better able to store heat than conventionnal stoves .
and so , i decided i wanted to build this stove rather than use the previous one that i had because i wanted to be putting less pollution into the atmosphere but also this stove , you actually feed wood into the top
which means that you can put long pieces of wood , directly into the stove and it doesn 't have to be cut to be able to burn .
so , i can put the wood in here and the burning actually happens down in the bottom of this area and then , the flue gas will travel through the stove there is a riser up inside the barrel itself
that creates a draft so that you can actually have the wood feeding in through the top and then the flue gas will travel up , hit the top of the barel on the inside and then there is an opening on the outside .
on the inside of the barrel but on the outside of the part that comes up in the middle .
all the flue gas will travel down around the outside of the barrel and out through the back and up , out of the chimney .
all this cob here that surrounds the stove is designed to capture the heat from the combustion so that it 's not just all going straight up the chimney .
with a conventionnal stove the heat tends to travel out of the building very quickly .
this allows for more of the heat to be stored in the building and then slowly the heat is released over time out of the cob .
so , this is the sky house rocket stove
it is a sort of a wall in between our dinning room and our living room .
basically , you got the intake here the barrel is here and you can see there is a very large amount of cob surrounding most of the barrel here .
this entire wall is actually a cob wall .
basically we got a lot more mass to store heat in we 've got a little bit of area where the barrel is exposed so that is gonna through heat in the room quickly when you first light the stove but for the most part we are looking at the stove
to store heat for a long time and we burn the fire here in the morning , we can run it for a few hours and all of this cob will still be warm into the evening .
so , here we are on the other side of the wall , in the dining room .
here is the other side of the barrel encased in cob and then the flue of the rocket stove runs all the way through this bench and up that chimney .
one of the benefit of the rocket stove is that you can have a long horizontal run of your flue pipe and you can monitor a bench or under a bed or wherever you want to store that heat .
normally we have a table here so this one of the seat of the table , that is very popular when we are in winter cause this area gonna stay warm pretty much all day until the evening if we fire the rocket stove that day .
there is about 4 to 6 inches of cob on top of the flue here on the bench so they can take a few hours before it heats up .
i would say 2 or 3 hours but then it wil stay warm throughout the day .
the front of the rocket stove there is only about 2 inches between the flue and the front and that heats up a little faster sometimes it is almost a little too hot so that 4 inches is really great if it 's going
to be an area , where you are physically in contact with .
like this bench .
we oil the bench to waterproof it cause it is near the table .
the chimney runs up as cob all the way up into the second story and that , again stores thermal mass up into the bedrooms , upstairs as well .

welcome to basalt mountain located on the northern rim of the roaring fork valley in colorado .
the climate here is hot and dry in the summer and frigid in the winter .
to the point were only a small number of plant and animal species can survive here .
until now no one would have considered farming in this dry rocky nutrient poor soil .
but thanks to our current understanding of nature 's natural processes one man has built up a nutrient rich soil upon this dry undesirable clay forming the foundation for a thriving ecosystem
jerome osentowski is the man behind the ecosystem and the central rocky mountain permaculture institute .
nestled on the side of basalt mountain lye one acre of edible forest garden guilds and four passive and active solar greenhouses which have become a large part of jerome 's most recent permaculture endeavors
i came to colorado in 1969 and i spent about the first seven or eight , ten years as a ski instructor .
and gradually got interested in healthy foods
through having somewhat of a health crisis with hyperglycemia so i decided to look into wild foods and that lead me into growing my own gardens and using wild foods when it was available
jerome began gardening in the lowlands of the basalt area with the understand that it would be too difficult to grow near his home on basalt mountain due to the arid soils and difficulty in harnessing water but once i learned about permaculture
i found that it was totally possible to create these beautiful gardens using recycled materials , and building compost , sheet mulching , using perennial and annual vegetables
in combinations of designs
so , we started annual gardening here for ten years or so and then we gradually segued into perennial polycultures outside and now inside and we 've taught hundreds of people here through internship programs and through the different design courses and workshops here .
what 's nice about it is that they can come and eat the fruits see the combination of plants in our forest gardens and see how we build our greenhouse
but jerome 's success in permaculture hasn 't come without some major road blocks
in 2008 a devastating fire burned down one of his first tropical greenhouse 's ironically named pele [ after the hawaiian fire goddess ] to the ground .
the fire in pele was actually a blessing in disguise .
because we were able to take new technology and design a much bigger , better greenhouse .
so i worked with michael thomson my partner in ecosystems design to redesign the new greenhouse .
at the time that pele burned down jerome had been working with well know local architect michael thompson on advancing greenhouse design by introducing what jerome called " climate battery technology "
the destruction of pele gave the two the chance to put their latest research to the test and in the spirit on new beginnings the new greenhouse would be named phoenix after the mythological bird that burns itself and rises from the ashes to live through another cycle .
hi i 'm michael thompson ,
i 'm chief architect with ecosystems design in basalt colorado and partner with jerome osentowski .
the climate battery as we now call it , is a series of tubing in which air is taken in at the high point of the greenhouse , pumped through tubing , and exhausted at the south end of the greenhouse .
and then that air circulates over and over again picking up heat and then delivering it underground and storing it .
so at ecosystems design , we create designs for greenhouses and passive solar buildings and homes as well as outdoor landscaping perennials and annuals for organic agriculture in the rocky mountain region .
in addition to designing indoor and outdoor permaculture and edible landscapes
we create the buildings that allow that indoor growing , such as this one in steamboat springs .
this is a large thirty six by eighty foot greenhouse that will support sub-tropical and anything below that .
and here we have inside the greenhouse , all of these planting beds that we have created above ground and under ground we have these forced air heat storage systems
so all of these fans are delivering air through these vertical risers which then underground distribute the warm air through these horizontal manifolds through these perforated tubes that deliver the heat and the moisture from that air into the soil for use later in the cold nights .
so as a result we get these indoor environments that are very well insulated and heated against winter conditions such as this last year .
and when we have a condition like this where we have very cold weather and snow around the building inside what were experiencing is uhh ...
this is when we began the planting of this greenhouse last autumn , and this spring we had this much growth in there .
so we have flowers , we have other plants that support the insect populations for beneficial controls and for pollination , and we have all of the soil conditions and the climate conditions to grow tropical banana plants , and guavas and figs and papaya etcetera .
and these greenhouses also function very well as early propagation centers
where we can start the plants in february that will grow outdoors as annuals .
we also have climate control equipment like these curtains that draw across underneath the glazing at night when its very cold so we have an extra insulating layer for accomplishing that .
so we also do solar homes solar energy productive buildings .
in addition to designing greenhouses for private investors crmpi and growing spaces are building growing domes for local schools in colorado in order to raise awareness about the importance of a local food economy .
the institute has currently built a growing dome at yampa mountain high school in glenwood springs and the roaring fork high school in carbondale both facilities will be utilized as classrooms for sustainable agriculture curriculums and the food produced will be integrated into the school lunches. there you can find out more about our services and browse our design galleries .
for more information about the central rocky mountain permaculture institute and how you can contribute please visit crmpi.org there you 'll find detailed information about our growing dome projects via the community food initiative as well as workshop dates and internship availability .
and built the geodesic growing domes used at the local high schools and special thanks to john cruickshank for his role in the technological advancements of what is now called the climate battery

water is
water is life .
bassin de rétention d 'eau à tamera ( portugal )
avec sepp holzer et benrd müller
water is life .
water is the most important thing .
the whole world is 70 % water .
we , animals , everything-70 % water .
water is the key issue for the survival human kind on this planet .
nature has provided enough water everywhere on earth ;
but , a billion people do not have sufficient access to clean drinking water .
more and more regions lack the water to grow the food they need .
centralized systems of artificial water management cannot solve this problem .
we need de-centralized systems of natural water management .
we are in tamera peace research center in southern portugal , where a water retention landscape has been in development since summer 2007 .
bernd muller is responsible for tamera 's ecological research work .
in 2007 the community of tamera still had the question whether a site of this size threatened by desertification could provide food , water and energy for 300 people .
we visited sepp holzer and asked him this question and he brought us this gift the vision of a water landscape .
sepp holzer , an austrian mountain farmer , is a well-known specialist and visionary for permaculture and landscape healing .
water is always at the core of his work .
for me water is the most important capital .
wherever it 's possible , you should create retention spaces and collect the rain water and re-learn with the water how to maintain a balance .
this is the most important thing because once you 've created the right hydrological balance ,
70 % of the work is done .
ou help rich vegetation to develop , diversity ecause nature can reveal itself and develop in the right way .
traveling through the world i have not seen a single situation , nation or land in which the development of a water retention landscape would not give the first important healing impulses .
in many parts of the world , countries are not able to feed their population anymore . they have been unable to maintain their natural wildlife for a long time .
as a consultant in many countries
sepp holzer sees the consequence of deforestation , monoculture , overgrazing and industrial agriculture .
all these factors destroy the natural water balance .
the soil is drying out . water is being lost and the retention space , the natural water storage system of the earth , is becoming dry and the flora and fauna disappear .
in the end the land will turn into desert or burn ecause it 's so dry .
you can see these problems happening all over the world , bringing huge catastrophes .
and the heavy rains come anyway .
what happens then ?
the water rushes down the slopes because the dry soil does not absorb the water .
when the soil is hotter than the falling rain it rejects the water .
only when the soil is cooler , when the vegetation is giving shadow then it attracts the water and lets it seep in .
this is the construction site for a new water retention space in tamera .
wherever you work with soil you can read the signs of erosion .
topsoil should actually form a thick , living layer everywhere on the ground which enables rainwater to filter in .
but , this layer has been eroded away .
now the topsoil lies in layers many meters thick in the bottom of valleys or is found as mud in rivers .
the surface of fields and sites higher up is depleted and barren .
de-centralized water retention landscapes give the water time to filter back into the earth body .
people always have the same questions , always the same worries , where will all this water come from ?
in such dusty dry soil without streams or a river .
how can i build a lake here ?
people have simply lost the knowledge of how to use the catchment area and the rain , the blessing of the water in the right way .
when i use the catchment area , thereupon , the lake will fill very quickly .
how much water can change a landscape in a short time .
we can see here , comparing tamera before the creation of lake 1 and today .
water retention landscapes can be built everywhere .
anywhere on earth .
a water retention space must not be sealed with concrete or plastic .
it is enough to build a dam out of natural material at the narrowest point of a valley .
you dig a ditch until you reach an impermeable layer .
on that solid ground you apply layer after layer of fine material , like moist clay and drive on it and roll it to build the water barrier .
this water barrier is the core of the dam .
for the outside of the dam i take course material , it doesn 't have to be dense and water-proof . of course ,
i will also have to compact it by driving on it and rolling it .
and like this , i build the whole dam , the water barrier in the core nd on the outside in a slope of 1 to 2 , 1 meter up and 2 meters along , like this i build the two layers together , up to the top .
the water retention spaces have winding banks , shallow and deep zones , a diverse vegetation of water plants and are built aligned to the prevailing wind direction this way the water is always moving , is enriched with oxygen ,
the water in a water retention landscape stays fresh and alive by itself .
since we created the first retention space , we can already keep much of the water from the winter rainfalls on the land .
in this way in can unfold its full healing capacity , the wildlife is responding and is returning and the vegetation is recovering .
we can plant fruit trees again , the forests recover and we can grow our food for people and for animals in the direct surroundings of the first retention space .
the water which used to run away and which is now stored here is at the same time also having an impact on the whole groundwater system .
in the first year , a spring developed below this lake which now gives water throughout the year .
since we built this first dam , we no longer have such big variations with a lot of flowing water in winter when it 's raining and droughts in the summer .
we have a more constant water situation throughout the year , which is of course a huge benefit for nature .
nature shows you how this works , you just have to ask her , have to contact her , to communicate with her , then you will be fine anywhere on earth .
ask nature , think with her and not against her .
put yourself in her place and you get all the answers you need .
make room in your head so that natural thinking has space to happen .
a forest garden is a three dimensional garden of useful plants .
so there 's trees , shrubs , ground cover plants , perennial plants all designed to maximise beneficial interactions and minimize competition , designed to be sustainable in the long term by having plants that feed other plants by having plants for bees to sustain a pollinating population ,
sustainable from other ways too , because most of the plants are perennial , you know trees or smaller plants and so the soil is not dug most of the time and not digging the soil is really important in term of sustainability
because every time you dig the soil , a lot of carbon goes into the air .
this is chinese dogwood , which is as you can see , a fantastic beautiful plant in flower but actually has a very nice edible fruit which follows later in the year .
apart from food , there are various other things you can grow and i do in this forest garden so i include medicinal plants ,
i include plants for dying , for basketry use , plants for fibers , there are of course a lot of bee plants , sometimes plants are here specifically for bees , so you might look at a particular plant in this forest garden
and i won 't necessarily harvest that plant myself it might have a system function in terms of feeding another plant , or it might be here specifically for bees because if flowers are at a good time of year for bees
and so on . so there is plants for all sources of different uses .
there 's ... i think forest gardens will have a role to play they are ... you know there is an awful lot of interest at the moment in forest gardens .
of course mainstream agriculture of course is completely dependent on oil , and you know what happens to oil will have a big effect and of course the oil price will may certainly go up and up over the decades to come ,
because , you know , demand will exceed supply . in this country particularly , you know , tree ... you know , farmers don 't tend to know much about trees and foresters don 't know much about farming and agroforestry which is kind of in the middle of the two
therefore is quite ... seems quite difficult for people and farmers to access because , you know , they are not comfortable with trees .
so that 's a potential problem that could slow down , you know , the implementation of more agroforestry based systems on farming .
but i think it needs to happen and i think slowly it will happen but ...
i think it will take ... unfortunalety i think it will take a crisis or two , you know a serious crisis or two , to actually jolt the powers of be into actually you know , making it happen quicker .
this is one of my main salad leaves from the forest garden , it 's the young leaf you use , this kind of leaf , not the old one , the old ones would be tough .
an interesting parallel to times which may be coming you know , when in the cold war years the soviet union did a lot of fruit breeding because they wanted to be self sufficient in fruit , you know , they didn 't want to have to import fruit from a long distance ,
well typically from , you know , the west .
and so they did a lot of interesting fruit breeding , this is one of the plants they bred in fact , and you know that has a parallel in that ... of course in the moment , as a country , you know , we import a lot of our food and there is no reason why we couldn 't , more or less ,
grow most of it here .
and of course that 's got to be sensible from our sustainability and our resilience aspects , it 's got to be sensible and our governments haven 't got it yet .
forest gardens are resilient because of the ... because of the diversity , really .
so , it 's diversity of structure so lots of different plants at different levels but also diversity of species , so this forest garden has about 550 species in it , which is probably more than most because i am doing a lot of research and experimenting as well ,
but , it 's very common for forest gardens to have 200 species and , you know , the majority of which would be food plants you know which ... to ask when we 're used to , you know , eating 20 types of vegetables or something ,
you know if you 're talking about 200 types of food plant , people , initially , might be slightly overwhelmed , but actually ...
i regard that as actually proving much more normal than relying on 20 you know i think ... if you look at if you look at our near relatives , things like orangutans they regularly eat 400 different types of leaf and fruit ,
they know everyone , they recognize every one , you know they know exactly what they are picking that 's no reason we couldn 't do the same .
and i suspect ... you know diverse diet will lead to more resilient people as well .
bamboos are fantastically useful plants and of course in china and japan or other parts of asia they use bamboo for more things that you could think of .
this one is growing about 20 cm a day at the moment , because of this warm weather so ... and you can actually hear them growing , bamboos are the only plants i can claim to have heard growing because when it 's growing that fast and you put your ear near the top
you can hear the fibers unfurling and crackling away .
so , if i just cut the top of that , and cut it down in the middle , it 's very interesting inside , you 'll see ... you can see what are going to be the nodes which are these bits on the bamboo cane
and everything inside this white or light green is edible , so you peel of the outer leaves and then the inside bit is edible you normally steam that ... just steam it for 5 or 10 minutes and then ... because they 're normally bitter raw .
this garden is now 16 years old and ... i 've certainly seen i 've seen climate changes in that time mainly , you know , increased average temperatures and fewer spring frosts .
dry springs is something that most farmers hate because they 've just sawed all their spring crops , or horticulturists for that matter , you know , and dry weather is just what they don 't want in spring so that can be quite severe in terms of growing annual plants
so , you know , obviously if you 're growing perennial plants a dry spring is , more or less irrelevant you know , won 't have very much effect at all and similarly , you know , extremes of weather at other times of year are gonna have much less effect
on perennial crops than on annuals as a rule .
fungi are probably the most important organisms of all in this forest garden , and of course most of the time we don 't see it because they are under the soil surface and ... the fungi i am talking about are mycorrhizal fungi
which are beneficial fungi that form relationships with almost all plant roots .
and they do some amazing things :
when they form an association with plant roots they basically give the plant hard to get nutrients because fungi can get those out of the ground much more efficiently than plants and the plant gives the fungi some sugars in return , so it 's kind of symbiosis .
but they do other things as well , they protect the plant from diseases and ... they move nutrients around in natural ecosystems and in something like a forest garden if there is more nutrients of one sort in one part of the soil
and a lack in another part of the soil , this fungi will move it , physically move it from one place to another and then the tree in another place will use it .
so that 's how things like nitrogen from my nitrogen fixing trees gets around to fruit trees that need it the fungi move it for you .
the other thing that this fungi do , which has really just been discovered in the last few years is critical in sequestering carbon in stable states in the soil .
so without them you wouldn 't get sequestration into the soil .
and of course you don 't get these fungi where you dig the soil .
and this huge potential you know for sequestering more carbon into the soil you know ... and certainly you know , everybody seems to want to do that but ... but to do that , you gonna have to move to a much more perennial system .
this is pokeroot which is a quite a well known american wild edible .
weedy shoots that come through which tend to be at the beginning of june so it 's kind of very late spring crop really and the shoots come as really thick like you can see here .
you cook those and they have a sort of healthy asparagus flavor to them really , really substantial vegetable .
but poisonous when it 's raw , you know , so you have to cook it but there 's lots of plants you know that we eat have little poison in one state or another otherwise i think if potatoes were discovered now they probably wouldn 't be allowed in this country
because you know green potatoes are quite poisonous .
i mean my estimate is that you could certainly feed 4-5 people of an acre of forest garden .
i use a lot of aromatic plants down in my perennial layers so a lot of different side sauce of mint for example and lemon balm or oregano , and other herbs some of which of course is harvested but ,
it 's doing some useful functions that 's some useful functions even if you don 't harvest it down this layer because you know they are rich in essential oils , mints and other aromatic plants and essential oils are anti bacterial and anti fungal so having those in the understory layers should have a protective effect you know for other plants in term of reducing bacterial diseases and fungal diseases .
the medlar is a fantastic fruit tree which a lot of people don 't know but you can see the young fruits here these grow to about 3-3.5 centimeters diameter and ripen on the tree in warm summers otherwise you pick them
at the first frost and taken indoors and then they ripe in with are sort of very sweet sort of date , baked apple type flavor to them really nice edible fruit ... and also , you know , again very low maintenance it doesn 't have any pests or diseases it just looks after itself .
monoculture crops have been dominating all agriculture research for hundreds of years and even now you know mainstream agriculture scientists they don 't like looking at more than one crop in one place , it makes things very complicated for them .
this is sichuan pepper which is obviously a commercial crop grown in china mainly but it 's a shrub as you can see a largely shrub and you can see it has just finished flowering it 's just starting to form the peppercorns here
and each of those will form a roundish fruit so the black seed in the middle and a sort of pink shell round the outside .
it 's actually that pink shell which is the spice you don 't have to use black pepper if you have something like this .

and it looks like many of them feel part of this place , feel like this is their home .
they feel like my life revolves around their life , they feel like they 're part of what 's going on here .

we do not have to remind ourselves of the announcement of shotan , also known by the name shé wéré .

senior mugo shotan o
shotan , shotan , shotan
they enjoyed it , especially during sunday jump .
did you see how full it was ?
everybody was happy , enjoying themselves , and jumping and everything , which is good .
and then they relax , you know ?
because in nigeria , life is not easy for anyone .
cost of living , there 's no lights , no water , the schools are poor ...
it 's not easy .
the salaries aren 't paid , pensions aren 't paid , so everything isn 't going smoothly .
we want to have somewhere you can sit , forget everything , go there for some time . i think it 's great .
femi 's doing a lot for them that way .
that 's another way of getting to the people .
if he continues like that , there 's no trouble .
there 's no trouble in the shrine when he 's there .
everything 's cool and organized .
whereas with fela , it was tough .
there were always problems there .
there were always problems .
education doesn 't work , hospitals don 't work properly , people are poor , police aren 't paid ...
i mean , no security , life is totally a mess here .
the papers tell us a different story from the reality of our lives .
a lot of people are in pain here now .
even me , i 'm comfortable , but when you see so much poverty , how can you be happy ?
after 40 years of independence , there is no area in nigeria where you have light constantly , water running constantly .
and we call ourselves independent ?
independence means you 're independent of asking for favors .
we can 't say we are independent , because we are still relying on many things to keep our country going .
i wanna be free from all these yeye politics
i wanna be free from all these yeye politicians
i wanna be free from all these corrupt monsters
because of the ideals of femi anikulapo-kuti , he has always found a positive way to project the black man .
we believe in black power , and that we can be trusted .
we want to convey that africans can mind themselves properly .
we want to do away with the myths in black mentality that the black man can 't do what he wants to achieve .
we 're trying to say things can work in africa , if our leaders do the right thing .
but most of all , if no one can do that , we should free ourselves .
i think that femi has found a better way to project this and continue fela 's hope to project the black image right .
to try to create another way to see that things can work in black africa .
i wanna be free from all these corrupt monsters
wey want to chop man
the king is dead
na dem kookuma kill the king for political reasons
dem no fit talk as e be
oya back to politics
dem start to scheme for the same corruption and thief
no plan for you and me
when we dey sleep
dey dem dey meet to plan their evil strategies
to control our resources
african leaders
and their foreign counterparts
e bi like from these evil monsters
we shall never be free
i wanna be free i said every day
every night
i ask myself
why , why , why
chee because fela die
that is why dem dey try to
confuse i and everybody mind
last sunday , i had my beret .
it was stolen today .
what do they want ?
- they stole my beret .
- sanctioned .
what do you mean , sanctioned ?
i told you they stole it !
did you hear him ?
i lent mine to him , over there .
they only gave me the shirt .
isoko , anyone give you a beret ?
he said he doesn 't have it .
i 'm wearing michael 's beret .
i had a beret , last week .
each time we go out in this uniform we hear people yell :
" femi 's child ! "
or " the shrine boys ! "
they do recognize us as one of the " shrine boys . "
fela , himself has already made the shrine popular for all the africans .
so when his son took over for him , people respect him like they respected his father .
when we put on this uniform we look as if we 're close to femi .
it 's hard for people to see femi , so when we wear this uniform , they say " this is femi 's security . "
that 's why we 're proud to wear this uniform .
i 'm proud to be working at the shrine , i 'll always be proud .
when i 'm going home , a policeman will ask me :
" where are you coming from at this hour of the night ? "
i tell him i 'm working security at the shrine .
he asks if i have my id card ,
i tell him i don 't have one .
this is the symbol of where i work .
as long as they can see this , they know that i work for femi .
so they allow me to go .
if dem want to hear we go tell them plenty things
if dem want to see we go show them many things
wey the african man wey the african woman
find it very difficult to succeed
na today dem no say mubotu no good
she na today dem no say company no good
see this african leaders
dem don kill all their people finish
look again obasanjo don kill nigerians
no not obasanjo and his padi paddies
dem dey try to give us different reason
to tell us say obasanjo no guilty
na today dem no say charles taylor no good
na today dem no say mugabe no good
my son omorimade afolabi anikulapo-kuti
see those african leaders rolari
dem don kill all their people finish
as we ought to know the reason why
the african man and the african woman find it difficult to su ... su ...
because you like to drink beer too much !
you like to suck breasts too much !
you 'd like to be sucking pussy too much !
... succeed !
with the dancing ... with the dancing , the anger , the suffering you still find joy and peace .
we 're letting so much frustration out of our system .
and all that is a language , without talking .
there is communication on that . i go to sleep ,
i can wake up the next day , move forward without stress .
if my body 's aching me or my girlfriend or ...
why do we need to have stress ?
and i hope the people who come here have that same kind of vibe .
i mean , what is life ?
to have peace of mind , know what to do the next day , how to deal with life .
so if the shrine can do that to everybody , or anybody , i won 't call it a church or mosque ,
i 'll just say it 's life , shrine .
i won 't say god is here , god is not . god is here , but he 's everywhere .
i will not go under the umbrella of religion , i 'll make it spiritual . it 's limitless .
i will not say :
" this is where to be , " but " at least you can be . "
keyboard !
yeah , i play the base guitar .
i dance .
he plays guitar .
i dance on stage .
i play the trumpet .
i play the shakers .
i 'm a percussionist .
this is the band leader !
if i can take this country , then africa is settled .
once there 's a good government in 1 country , they 'll be liberated .
only one straight , progressive clean government that knows what it 's doing .
no diplomacy , no compromises ,
and no marxism-leninism , no capitalism .
africanism !
the time don come
for me to talk
before i talk
make i thank everyone
for the support you na give my family
during our troubles
you my friends una dey with me ninety-seven
i shall never forget
ninety-seven the pain ! the sorrow !
i want to thank you my friends
jigbolo , jijigbolo , jigbolo !
oh yes i remember
the day all of us we gathered
to pay our respect to the
one and only fela
we carry am go him house
before him spirit go for eledumare palace i say
together we walka
carry fela oh
for those wey no know na that dey them know
say the people them love fela oh
together we walka
i 've never seen anybody in this whole country or in all of africa ...
only 2 people are walking the streets of power :
nkrumah and my mother !
that 's what i 'm talking about !
all these dirty politicians who sit on their asses !
the young and the old the strong and the weak
the rich and the poor
them gathered to carry fela
together we walka
and then as we want start to relax
we no know our problems
just start from nowhere we hear
cousin fran just pass
just like that she die
we start to wonder why
enough is enough
the people start to talk
the problems don too much
again as we start to relax and then suddenly we hear
na the matter of my sister ' sola come make all of us weak for body
again we ask ourselves why
for she was too young to die
as we dey cry na so we dey try
we dey struggle to save her life
the doctors them dey lie
them want to get money to survive
the thing wey dey pain me pass
na the way she suffer before she died
na so them dey cut cut
dey chook chook making experiment with human life
oh my sister ' sola oh oh oh
ninety-seven
ninety-seven i shall never forget
oh yes i remember
music is the way for us . music is the thing of the future .
music is the weapon of the future .
femi takes care of everybody , street boys , everybody .
we live okay here .
in nigeria , only femi takes care of everybody .
he 's concerned about poverty , concerned about corruption , the poor ...
in nigeria he 's a great man , femi anikulapo-kuti , and he did many songs to let people know
so we have a lot of music to let you know what is going on in nigeria and africa .
femi 's making people know , and wants to know more .
if you want to know more , come to the shrine .
that 's all .
he 's like a prophet who has come to make people realize ...
he 's a prophet who makes people realize that they must fight for their rights , like one of his best tracks , democrazy .
and now we realize that the government makes us mad , when you get mad , that 's shotan .
shotan , it 's like the destructive kid the mother didn 't want to have .
that 's what our government made us be .
but thank god , we have the shrine , we have survival .
and we are ready to serve the true prophet .
- not true ?
- it 's true !
we do something for ourselves !
we want to move further ,
we want to go to university !
but our presidents only watch themselves , rule themselves . and the country 's getting worse and worse .
prices always go up , food , people are dying !
food prices .
no light , no good education , no good nothing !
mr. president , we 're begging you !
we fight for our rights , man !
we 're fighting together , doing something for ourselves !
for ourselves , for our lives !
femi kuti tells us how to think for ourselves .
because some people are millionaires , while the country is going bad , bad !
the frustration is too much .
sometimes when i 'm walking i see the policemen beat people like dogs .
the policemen beat us like dogs .
not true ?
it 's true , man !
the afrika shrine be my neighborhood
every night , i 'm there at afrika shrine
the ladies do as they like at the shrine
everybody does as they like at the shrine
every night they meet at the afrika shrine
neighborhood
all africans are my neighbors
the ladies like my neighborhood
the man we call femi is a prophet .
we all serve him .
he 's given us the message to keep the place clean .
we make sure it 's clean .
we have found a survivor , we are pleased with him .
we are happy .
we are people from places like ajegunle and mushin , places where people go without eating .
we 're here , we found survival with him .
we serve him .
that 's why this place is clean .
if i leave for 5 minutes , this place will be messed up .
i must be here to make sure this place is clean .
so he 'll be pleased with me , and i 'll be happy he 's pleased .
bring me
bring me the man now
i believe right now there 's so much energy here .
and you can manipulate this energy for you .
my role is taking the energy of music and transforming it into dance .
if i achieve that , it 's a force .
music is a powerful force .
i take that sound , truly , not trickery or lies .
i take that energy and go pow ...
and make people really go crazy .
how ?
it 's magic .
people ask me how i did it , i don 't know .
because i do the right thing , that energy is using me as a medium to express many things through music .
now that energy is a constant thing , 24 hours a day .
you can use that energy to understand , for many things .
say you have a headache , somebody will be able to just touch your head , you 'll feel a kind of ease because of the true love .
you take the energy : " you have a headache ? where ? "
and that person will have calm .
i beg live me
no disturb me with nonsense gist
the fine things of life these people don 't see
their bad mind no gree make dem get better dream
with their crooked legs dem walka go redem
but salvation comes from within
seek and ye shall find
definitely with music
whose rich harmonies and melodies
will truly bring peace
all in the name of peace
we fight and kill to find justice
for me na only music
from the voice of the soul we speak
wetin concern me with english
na dem koko greedy dem selfish
my sisters
they bank africa money like the swiss
oyinbo don kill africa finish
femi , don 't go !
the son of fela " baba 70 . "
don 't go !
i think it 's the most challenging place to compose .
if the shrine people love it , then i 'm not worried , really .
i 'm not really worried , because i 'm very critical of myself . if i don 't like it , if i don 't feel something , i will not continue the work .
after the completion of the shrine ,
i found that i was alone , and i just saw myself sinking deep into music .
and on getting where i am in life , i found that the only friend i have , the only thing i can trust , is myself .
and it 's difficult to really trust yourself .
you don 't want to do something , then you do it .
the only thing i have confidence in , in my life , 100 % , is music .
even if you don 't give your life to music , music will take you over .
so , i just let myself go and wherever music takes me , so be it .
i have no worries concerning that .
i 'm not sad .
i mean , i have peace .
sometimes i look annoyed , it 's things around me , or things people said . i am a very happy man , very happy .
sometimes i love being alone , i love being in my own world because this world is crazy .
i don 't see anything in this world that makes sense .
you prefer to be alone ?
i feel safer that way .
don 't forget , i 'm not alone in that respect .
i have the force of music , running like a wild fountain in my head .
that alone , i am never at peace .
and i love the feeling music gives me .
i 'll never compromise that , for nothing in this world .
nothing .
not even myself .
i will starve myself for music .
no way , can never give it up .
out of the way !
calm down !
out of the way !
may your future be bright !
everywhere i go i see injustice
in government and our nonsense policies
marxism , socialism , call it what you want
capitalism all na the same oppression dey
injustice , misuse of power na dem specialty
pretending they want to help the human race 1 , 2 , 3 , 4
wetin dem dey wait for ?
5 , 6 , 7 , 8
dem no say time no dey wait 1 , 2 , 3 , 4
wetin dem dey wait for ?

in africa we say only the lion borns the lion .
and if a lion borns a goat ... there 's a problem .
so , as the lion born the lion , the lion born the lion .
that 's me .
jane quimby .
my life is a little complicated right now .
i landed my fashion dream job working for her ,
gray chandler murray .
the only problem , they think i 'm an adult .
now i am juggling two secret lives , one in high school and one in high fashion .
do you trust india ?
i just think she 's a little shady .
i 'm afraid we have to say goodbye .
i hope you 're happy .
you did this to yourself , india .
you got the wrong person .
all right , fellas .
here 's how it 's going down .
are you robbing this place , tommy ?
let 's go !
let 's go !
a couple months at new hall youth detention might give mr. nutter ample time to think about those mistakes and their implications .
i saw her with nick .
they were kissing , janey .
it 's not what you think .
- just let me ...
- don 't .
i can 't talk to you .
and you really deserve the perfect guy , rita shaw .
you are perfect .
i really have no idea how to say this .
so i 'm just gonna say it .
it 's you , janey .
jane .
jane !
let 's go .
you 're gonna be late for school again , truant .
that guidance counselor of yours is gonna come down on you hard .
you know how miss shaw can be .
ben .
it 's a little weird that you call your girlfriend " miss shaw . "
oh , you mean rita .
hey .
are you really that busy ?
yes .
and no .
i 'm nervous , ben .
two months is a long time .
what if billy 's different ?
what if he doesn 't want to see me ?
jane . he was in a juvenile detention center , not a brainwashing camp .
you 'll be the first person he wants to see .
besides , why would anything be different with you two ?
well , the thing is i might not have told you everything that happened that night at the fashion show .
see , when billy showed up he sort of ...
well , he ...
i 'm waiting .
bated breath over here .
he said something .
and would you like to tell me what that something was , exactly ?
he said , " it 's you . "
- it 's you ?
- yeah .
- oh , boy .
- what ?
then what happened ?
well , then jeremy came in and i didn 't know what to do and then billy ran out and the next morning he got sent away and for the past two months it 's been playing on a loop in my head .
" it 's you , it 's you , it 's you . " what do you think it means ?
well , i may be totally off-base here , but did you ever think he might have meant it romantically ?
no .
no , no , no .
i did think that for a second .
but i don 't think that 's it .
but i guess it can be .
i don 't know .
maybe it is .
i don 't know .
would that be so weird ?
well , he 's my best friend and i don 't want to run the risk of ruining that , right ?
- i can 't answer that .
- then what good are you ?
just go pick up billy and you two will figure it out .
you know why ?
because you guys are like this .
you can figure out anything .
i sure hope so .
i missed you .
i missed you , too , janey .
jane by design 1x11
- the replacement original air date june 5 , 2012
that 's it ?
yeah , i mean , i don 't know what else to say .
it was pretty uneventful .
you were in a juvenile detention center .
so ?
so , was it scary ?
were the guards mean ?
did you make any friends ?
how was the food ?
did you ...
jane . look .
i wasn 't in alcatraz or anything , okay ?
i just ...
i 'd rather talk about something else , okay ?
okay .
maybe we should talk about , you know ...
yeah , you !
so , what about you ?
what 's been going on with that whole super secret double life of yours since i 've been away ?
oh . nothing , really .
- how 's jeremy ?
- jeremy ?
yeah , you guys are together , right ?
no .
we 've never been together .
he doesn 't even know that i 'm in high school .
and we work together .
i could never do that .
speaking of work .
how is it ?
well , things have been crazy ever since india got fired .
gray has been using me for everything .
it 's nuts .
and she 's been through at least a dozen people to fill india 's job .
wow .
that 's a lot of people .
tell me about it .
and you should see the stuff that she 's having me do .
i can 't even believe it .
i mean , don 't get me wrong ,
i love being creatively involved at donovan decker ...
you okay ?
let 's just say to be back here again .
and this place same way about me .
don 't worry about them .
and , billy ...
yeah ?
are we okay ?
shouldn 't we , talk or something ?
you 've been talking non-stop ever since we got in the car , jane .
right .
i mean , about ...
we 're good .
yeah .
there 's nothing for us to talk about , okay ?
unless you want to talk about that .
you have got to be kidding me .
yep .
lulu and nick .
they 've been an item ever since you left school .
looks like it 's just back to being the two of us .
yeah .
the two of us .
jane , i have to be honest .
i 'm a little disappointed .
disappointed ?
i 'm just surprised .
that 's all .
this progress report does not reflect the academic performance of the jane quimby that i know .
your grades are slipping in every class but ceramics .
well , that 's good , right ?
- your brother got an a in ceramics .
- ouch .
and it 's not just your grades .
your attendance last month ?
let 's just say it was less than perfect .
i know .
i 'm sorry .
this internship is interfering with your life .
your grades aren 't what they used to be , you have multiple tardies and absences and that just can 't happen .
i know , i know .
but i 'm not just looking off into the future for my dream job .
i mean , i 'm already here .
this is my life .
it 's just an internship , jane .
it 's not .
i 'm working with designers and i 'm being exposed to this whole world of fashion that you can 't learn in a classroom .
i 'm living it every day .
you can 't buy that kind of experience , you know ?
fine .
but i need to see some real changes .
because if this doesn 't improve , i can 't sign off on the internship program for you next semester .
especially if you 're not ...
wait .
are you texting someone right now ?
uh , what ?
no .
i am just typing a reminder to myself to shape up at school .
stat .
i promise i 'll get things back on track at school .
you have my word .
sorry .
i know this might sound harsh , but you 've been an incredible disappointment , sally .
it 's suzy .
your work has been lackluster .
your ideas , well , you simply have none .
in your time here at donovan decker , you 've yet to show any real promise .
but i 've only been working here for two days .
two days too many , i 'm afraid .
you 're fired .
that 'll be all .
what ?
that 's five this month , gray .
well , it 's been harder to replace india than i might 've realized .
perhaps if you ...
but i 'm not worried .
i have a new prospect in mind .
someone young and unexpected .
someone not boxed in by years of design experience .
you don 't mean ...
you 're not talking about ...
i have to go .
my next appointment is here .
oh , hi .
- hi .
- hi .
martyn !
gray , darling !
so . classic .
clean .
powerful .
it 's a whole new delicious look to match your title of creative director .
what do you think ?
do you like it ?
i 'm afraid i don 't .
i love it .
you 're a genius .
thank you , carter .
girl , how many hats does gray have you wearing right now ?
more than you own .
i doubt that .
am i the only one that 's twice as busy since india left ?
i think we 're all starting to feel the pressure .
but you more than anyone .
'cause whenever gray says jump ...
i say , " over whom ? " and , " in pumps or flats ? "
i just really hope this new girl works out .
well , don 't get your hopes up .
hey .
what can i do for you , muffin ?
that 's a " no " on kissing at work and the whole muffin thing .
yeah , i know .
it didn 't quite feel right coming out .
i need the kids here to respect me , ben .
we need to be professional .
got it .
we 're on the same page .
so , what 's up ?
i had a conversation with jane this morning .
i 'm just a little concerned .
don 't worry .
she 's good with it .
- with what ?
- with us dating .
no . ben . i 'm concerned about jane .
i just got her progress report and she 's falling behind .
i think this internship is just too demanding on her , don 't you ?
actually , i kind of think it 's been good .
but i promise i 'll make sure she stays focused on school .
you know why ?
because your love life depends on it ?
bingo .
i know you 've all been working tremendously hard lately .
but you 're gonna have to work tremendously harder .
donovan decker has been selected to collaborate on a capsule collection with one of the world 's most famous luxury department stores ,
harrods .
that is , unless we blow it .
and we cannot blow it .
understood ?
okay .
didn 't i fire you ?
no .
oh .
see me in my office afterwards .
the style director assigned to oversee our harrods collection will be coming by tomorrow .
now , can anyone tell me what is our number one priority ?
carter ?
um , to impress the style director and ensure harrods is confident that donovan decker has what it takes ?
precisely .
now , i need all hands on deck for the next two days .
no exceptions .
is that clear ?
if that is clear , then walk away and get back to work .
now .
can i talk to you for a moment ?
as long as gray doesn 't see .
because apparently , we 're all supposed to be working tremendously harder than we were before .
whatever that means .
did you hear that she fired sally ?
- do you mean suzy ?
- right .
oh , my gosh .
i 'm turning into gray , aren 't i ?
- jane ...
- not that that would be a bad thing .
- i just think ... what ?
- jane !
i 'm going to tell you something and i need you not to react , okay ?
- okay ?
- no , no , no , no .
i 'm serious , jane .
okay .
gray is giving you india 's old job .
what ?
me ?
no reaction .
right .
take over india 's job ?
i am so not ready for that .
then you best get ready .
janey ?
you ready ?
almost !
i 'll be out in a minute !
- morning , miss shaw .
- good morning , billy .
you mind handing me the milk ?
yes .
of course .
oh , and miss shaw ?
yes , billy ?
i think your toast is ready .
wait .
you 're actually considering this ?
no .
yes ?
i don 't know .
i mean , taking india 's old job would be the opportunity of a lifetime .
how could i say no ?
- what 's wrong ?
- nothing , i ...
i just ...
you 'd really consider leaving here ?
just leaving school behind ?
maybe .
why ?
no reason .
talk to me , billy .
no , i 'm good .
oh , you 're good ?
is that right ?
yeah . it is .
- fine .
whatever .
- so , now you 're mad at me ?
yeah .
i am .
billy , you 've been shutting me out .
about everything .
what is going on with you ?
and how can i help if you won 't even talk to me ?
what do you want to talk about ?
for starters , how about the fashion show ?
you ran out before we could even have a conversation .
it was nothing , janey .
nothing ?
that 's your story ?
look , i was in a bad place .
i was getting sent away .
that 's it .
there 's nothing for us to talk about .
things are different now .
i 'm different .
yeah , tell me about it .
what is that supposed to mean ?
it means you have changed .
and , if you ask me , it 's not for the better .
i didn 't ask you , jane .
fine !
then be that way !
- i will !
- well , then do it !
i said i will !
what was that about ?
i don 't know , ben .
maybe i took your advice and i tried to talk to him about the whole " it 's you " thing and maybe it backfired .
sorry about that .
i 'm worried about billy .
it can 't be easy for him to fall back into his old life here .
well , maybe you could help him find something positive to focus on ?
such as ?
i don 't know , maybe an activity or something ?
like mathletes .
or chess club .
- i 'm being serious , rita .
- so am i.
come on .
chess ?
mathletes ?
what , do you want him to be more of an outcast ?
those are terrible clubs .
i was in those clubs , ben .
and you were adorable doing it .
shoot .
vice principal jenkins !
what a surprise to see you !
in the hall .
at school .
where we work .
hey , rita .
what 're you naughty kids up to this fine morning ?
naughty ?
why would you even ...
we are ... were ...
we were just talking .
that is all .
i said " mop " !
- and i 'll stop talking now .
- good idea .
good morning , jenkins .
good morning , rita .
and ...
ben .
that was close .
no .
that was awkward .
really awkward .
what 's gotten into you ?
you said you want to keep it professional at work , right ?
- do you think he knows ?
- knows what ?
about you and me , of course .
how would he know that , ben ?
are you kidding ?
we ooze chemistry .
don 't say ooze .
hi .
hi .
how are you , billy ?
oh , you know how it is , just trying to get my bearings back .
- that 's good .
- yep .
so , what 's been going on with you ?
sorry .
stupid question .
so , you and fadden , huh ?
how 's that one working out for you ?
to be honest , i thought it was going pretty well .
that is until you got back .
i thought i could forget about us , b ...
there is no more us , lu .
but i really do hope things between you and nick work out .
because you deserve it .
you 're precipitating .
- excuse me ?
- your calcium is starting to form a precipitate .
you should dry out the crystals .
oh .
um ...
thanks .
- busy , huh ?
- mmm-hmm .
you 're not gonna cut me any slack here , are you ?
maybe .
but just a little .
okay .
i guess i deserve that .
i 'm really sorry , jane .
for what it 's worth , i made a big mistake .
huge , in fact .
and i regret it .
it 's fine .
really , i 'm just distracted .
and you know what ?
i think it all worked out for the best .
you and lulu seem very happy .
yeah .
the thing is ...
i ...
is everything okay ?
yeah , it 's just , um ...
oh , i , uh ...
i have to go .
oh .
yeah .
thanks .
you wanted to see me , ben ?
good hands .
good hands .
thanks .
first day back .
how 're you doing ?
i 'm fine , ben .
oh , i get it .
this must be the part where you ask me how i 'm adjusting .
no , i just thought now that you 're back , you might want to hit the ground running .
find a positive outlet .
for what ?
i don 't know , something to keep you busy .
focus your energy .
such as ...
how about football ?
seriously ?
yeah .
you got a pair of hands on you .
i mean , you 're a little stringy , but you 're probably very elusive .
hard to tackle .
baseball ?
oh , my .
are you kidding me right now ?
why not just give it a shot ?
look , ben .
i appreciate you trying to help reacclimate me or whatever it is that you 're trying to do here .
but , in case you hadn 't noticed , i 'm not really the team sport type .
are you sure you 're doing okay ?
i 'm fine .
because , jane told me about ...
do you really want to do this , benjamin ?
- i 'd like to .
- i 'd prefer if we didn 't .
excuse me .
coming through .
i have to leave school because of an emergency at work and rita can 't know under any circumstances because then i would lose my internship and that can 't happen .
so i really need you guys to help me out okay ?
can you cover for me ?
- i don 't think so .
- no way .
what ?
look , i know that you are mad at me and that you don 't really like to do this sort of thing , but can 't you just cover for me ?
maybe like a cold , cramps , anything .
i don 't like lying to rita .
it 's just a teeny-tiny little white lie .
and that 's how it all starts .
that 's correct .
fine .
i don 't need your help .
i can handle this on my own .
oops .
sorry .
sorry .
that 's okay .
hey , i 'm actually a little lost .
oh , well , maybe i can point you in the right direction .
who are you delivering those to ?
you think i 'm a flower delivery guy ?
i did .
a second ago .
but now i 'm a little unsure .
they 're for gray chandler murray .
oh . great .
i 'm gray 's assistant .
jane .
so i can just take those to her .
i 'd rather give them to her myself if that 's okay .
the thing is gray 's not exactly the hand delivery type .
what type is she ?
she 's more of a " don 't bother me with that kind of crap " type .
so , if you 're not the flower delivery guy , who are you ?
eli .
i have an appointment with gray .
today ?
no , it 's tomorrow .
i just thought i 'd get here early in case i got lost .
why would you get here a whole day ...
oh , that was a joke .
- funny .
- you didn 't laugh .
well , it wasn 't laugh out loud funny .
the thing is gray doesn 't have any appointments today .
well , she called me directly .
gray ?
called you ?
on the phone ?
yeah .
crazy , right ?
so , what is this appointment about ?
something about a job opening .
a job .
and you 're interviewing for it ?
yeah .
are you gonna point me in the right direction or should i ...
oh , gosh .
yes , sorry .
right this way .
so , you got any tips for me ?
tips ?
yeah , you know , like advice for the interview .
oh , um , just don 't take anything gray says to you personally .
she can be a little cold .
so , you 're saying she 's mean ?
oh , no , no , no .
not mean .
- she 's just not very ...
- nice ?
eli , you 're here !
oh !
and you brought me flowers .
yeah , well , i haven 't seen you in a while .
and i know lilies are your favorite .
jane , i see you 've met my nephew , eli .
yeah , we ...
nephew ?
yeah .
jane was actually just talking about you .
oh . and what did she say ?
only that you 're warm and gorgeous and incredibly talented .
is that right ?
that is right .
eli , come into my office .
jane , hold all my calls .
it was nice to meet you , jane .
nephew ?
who is that ?
his name is eli .
i don 't like the look of him .
well , you should probably keep that one to yourself .
and why is that ?
because he is gray 's nephew .
and from the looks of it , he might also be india 's new replacement .
he seems great .
he is .
something you want to add ?
no .
i ...
spit it out , jane .
i just ...
i feel a little silly saying this , but for a second there i thought that i was in the running for india 's job .
you are .
where 's jane ?
my sister , jane ?
yes , ben .
your sister jane .
i heard she went home early .
and right after i had that talk with her .
did you know about this ?
yes . i am aware of her departure .
what 'd she say ?
she said some things about cramps .
cramps .
cramps . you know , lady stuff .
i 'm not that familiar with lady stuff , so i 'd really rather not discuss it .
hi , billy .
hello , miss shaw .
i heard jane went home .
she okay ?
she 'll be fine .
just a cold .
- is that right ?
- mmm-hmm .
- a cold ?
- yeah .
all right , peace .
white chocolate half-caff latte .
your favorite .
and i picked up the tear sheets that you wanted this morning .
and i got you a reservation tomorrow night at per se .
i thought you said they were booked up for the next two months .
they are . i pulled some strings .
well done , jane .
and i thought you might like to take a look at these .
- what 's this ?
- some sketches .
of mine .
just some new ideas for the accessories line .
i 'll take a look .
impressive .
you 're still here .
yeah , gray said i should stick around a while and check out the place .
is that right ?
it is .
that 's nice .
hey .
hello , jane .
can i ask you a question ?
- you just did .
- what ?
you asked if you could ask me something .
technically , that is a question .
sometimes you are way too british .
there 's no such thing .
okay , come on , i 'm serious , jeremy .
at your service , miss quimby .
okay , so about this whole job offer thing .
do you really think it 's a good idea ?
in what respect ?
well , in that i 'm an assistant .
and the closest i 've come to studying design is , i don 't know , the endless hours i spent and fashion magazines every weekend .
this is a huge job .
why would gray trust me to handle something like this ?
because you can .
eli seems way more qualified and he 's ...
he 's nothing to worry about .
you have to run your own race , jane .
and you , you 've got what it takes .
you really think so ?
i know so .
plus , you deserve it .
thank you .
i just really don 't know if this is the right thing for me right now .
are you insane ?
i have a lot of stuff going on at home .
my best friend was away for a while and now he 's back and ...
is this the same friend from the fashion show ?
isn 't he the reason you turned me down ?
jeremy , we 've talked about this .
you 're my mentor and my friend .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
no need to rub it in .
all i 'm saying is i don 't know if it 's the right time to leave him ...
to leave him behind .
that is why he was so upset .
i 'm not really following your chain of thought here .
oh , it 's nothing .
sorry .
thank you .
thank you for all of your help .
you 're welcome .
sup ?
wow !
one one thousand , two one thousand , three one thousand ...
- hey , you .
- what 's going on with you ?
i was parched .
you 're avoiding me .
what are you talking about ?
i 'm trying to keep things discreet .
between us .
you know ?
you 're lying to me about jane .
what ?
no .
billy said she has a cold .
- that was me !
- you said she had cramps .
did not .
i have to go .
go where ?
i have to go to the house to check on jane .
you 've got me really worried about these cold cramps .
that 's a great idea . i 'm going with you .
and if jane isn 't home sick in bed , that internship of hers is over .
- you have to get jane home !
now !
- what happened ?
the collective brain power of you and me .
that 's what happened .
you said cramps , didn 't you ?
there 's no time for blame .
yes . i said cramps .
you just couldn 't stay out of it , could you ?
i told rita that i was going home to check on jane , and now she 's coming with me .
so jane has to be home , in bed , sick , and fast .
i thought we were staying out of it .
can 't you just call her ?
i 've called her like a dozen times .
it keeps going to voicemail .
ben , it 's just the whole racing to save jane thing , it 's not really my problem anymore .
look .
i 'm not happy about this either , and i know you two are going through some sort of weird time right now , but she needs us .
otherwise this whole fashion dream thing of hers is out the window .
she 's my sister .
i can 't bring myself to do that to her .
can you ?
i can 't compete with this guy .
trust me .
she 's not going to hire her nephew .
you sure about that ?
look , i didn 't go to school for design .
and i know my technique isn 't exactly refined like the rest of you extremely talented people .
but , given the chance , i might be able to bring something new to the table here at donovan decker .
something different .
something fresh .
now i heard that you 're already selling your own line , is that true ?
i do what i can .
mostly , right now i 'm just selling my stuff at pop-up shops or on the street .
honestly , the money i make barely covers materials , but i love it .
and that 's what it 's all about .
yeah , i think so , too , carter .
are you listening to this ?
he 's perfect .
he 's charming and talented and good-looking
he 's not that good-looking .
i 'm serious , jeremy .
there 's no way i actually have a chance of getting this job .
not if i 'm up against a guy like that .
which i am .
please . it 's a courtesy , jane .
a family obligation .
this is gray we 're talking about .
she 's not going to actually hire anyone she has to be nice to .
good point .
you are probably right .
yeah , i 'm always right .
you said we were leaving to check on jane 20 minutes ago .
and we are .
i just have to grade a few more of these puppies and we are on our way .
ten minutes , ben .
and then we 're going .
understood ?
understood .
and if i find out you are lying , we 're gonna have a serious issue .
i 'm pleased to announce that i have found the perfect person to fill the vacancy left by india jourdain .
- it 's you .
- what ?
i 'm certain of it .
this person has proven that they have exceptional creativity and style .
this person is destined to be a rising star here at donovan decker .
this person is ...
wait !
what , jane ?
i 'm sorry .
i just ...
i can 't .
can 't ?
i can 't do this .
i 'd like to take myself out of the running .
i 'm so sorry , gray .
i really am grateful .
i just ...
i don 't think i 'm ready for this .
and i agree .
which is why i 'm pleased to introduce our newest designer ,
eli chandler .
billy , what are you doing here ?
- we need to get you home .
- what happened ?
what do you think happened ?
ben said cramps , didn 't he ?
yeah . you know your brother doesn 't think fast on his feet .
this is true .
and now miss shaw is on her way to your house to visit your sickbed .
what do you think 's faster right now ?
5th or lex ?
we 're gonna have to ...
you came for me .
i did .
and i 'm not gonna let that be for nothing .
come on .
we have to get you home . now .
jane , i 'm on my way to the house .
i 've stalled as long as i can and i just can 't keep lying to rita .
your chariot awaits .
mmm-hmm .
drive .
now .
what was that for ?
no reason .
- oh , this is a shortcut .
- oh !
come on , janey !
oh , wait .
pajamas !
jane ?
jane ?
are you feeling okay ?
maybe we should just let her sleep a little bit .
wait a minute .
what is going on here ?
oh , hey guys .
i 'm feeling much ...
much better .
i just have a cold .
and cramps .
so i just needed to ...
double whammy .
hmm . well , feel better , okay , jane ?
thanks , miss shaw .
- i 'm sorry , ben .
- for what ?
for the whole manhunt thing .
coming down on you .
honestly , i feel terrible for questioning you , accusing you of lying .
i don 't know what got into me .
i think you 're just being the best guidance counselor in the history of guidance counselors , that 's all .
thank you .
that was far , far too close .
tell me about it .
oh , my gosh .
and how about me turning down that job that i wasn 't even being offered ?
so embarrassing .
it wasn 't so bad .
okay , it was pretty bad .
i counted eight people cringing .
did you count me ?
okay .
nine .
i know you wanted that job .

and i am definitely not ready to leave you .
two months away .
it was a long time , billy .
i missed you .
i missed you , too , janey .
being away was terrible and lonely .
but knowing you 'd be here waiting was the only thing that got me through .
i have to ask you ...
you said , " it 's you , "
and i need to know if you meant ...
i meant
that it 's you , janey .
you are my best friend .
the very best .
and i don 't want that to ever change .
because that 's what 's most important , right ?
yeah .
it is .

said morocco , didn 't they ?
yeah , i know that . but where ?
did they show you the pictures ?
what pictures ?
what do you say to ' em rick ? nothing .
obviously . don 't tell them anything , all right .
not until we get some kind of legal representation . someone from the embassy - amnesty or someone . how you gonna get in touch with them ?
who are they anyway ?
they 're some kind of militia or something , aren 't they ?
they knew we had that money . they picked us off . they 're probably using the money for some extremist movement .
he was wearing a shirt , with a marks and spencer 's label on . i saw it sticking out .
who ? my interrogator . i mean , extremists ...
they might .
shall we go and help him ?
best not to get involved .
you all right , mate ?
it 's a woman . serious . it 's a bird !
argh ! i was just trying to see if you were ok . i 'm quinn .
what sort of fag name is that ?
dunno . ask my dad . named after my grandfather , i think .
i 'm mercedes . hi .
- your dad into cars then ?
- heard of the count of monte cristo , dumb fuck ?
yeah ... no ... yeah - fuck , i dunno , i can 't remember .
can i just ask , what 's with all the rough stuff ?
it 's what they do if you don 't tell them what they want . who are they ?
a bunch of cocksuckers ! come on ! do you have any idea how we might get in touch with someone from the british government ?
yeah , it 's easy . they 're in there . eh ?
what ?
it 's the foreign office . sorry . what is this place exactly ?
it 's where they bring people to question ... .. when they don 't want anyone to know they 're doing it .
a week ago , i was standing in line , holding a tuna baguette , queuing up for easyjet . now i 'm being fucking renditioned !
" dear god , please help me see danger coming my way , " and forgive the body count i will be sending your way . "
" never pick up a dead man 's gun . " " i ... .. " heart ...
right . we should go en masse and demand to speak to whoever 's in charge and make them understand they can 't just keep us here . there 's laws and protocols ...
you think they 'll care about that ? they still have to abide by them .
woody , this is our government . governments can 't just hold us indefinitely for no reason . what you on about ?
course they can ! they do it all the time . you remember those plane spotters in greece ?
they said they were spies . and what about guantanamo ?
nobody even knew who was in there . get off ! come on !
all right ?
how did you end up here then , love ?
i was in kabul , " love . "
you in the army then ?
no , i went there because i like the opera .
didn 't like what i saw , so i went awol . took a long fucking walk . posted some things on the web .
secrets ? there are no secrets . only hidden truths .
how long do they usually keep people in here for ? as long as they want . that 's the point .
fellas , can i ... have a word ? in private .
this could be a trick . she could be working for them .
you not seen her face ?
what , you not talking to me now ?
i ain 't the enemy . anyway , if i wanted info out of you , i 'd just .... .. beat it out of you .
ever had a cauliflower ear , quinn ? or a wet willy ?
you know what churchill said ?
fuck off !
" if you 're going through hell , keep going . "
tough it out , guys ! you can get through this . you got each other for a start .
put our time to good use . only trying to help , knobhead . well , you 're not .
so , what , do you think it 's somehow harder for you , quinn ?
i don 't think anything , bax . because i 'm stuck in an illegal prison in the middle of the sahara fucking desert . and why am i here ?
because you persuaded me that a weekend away would be " a laugh . " i persuaded you ? you called me .
i 've never called you , baxter . i 've never called you because i cannot bear your incessant moaning and complaining . oh , right , great - thanks .
yup . here we go . here we go .
nice toughing it out guys .
oi , quinnbo , you know there 's no " i " in team , don 't you ? no . but there 's a " u " in " fuck you . "

stop it ! get off ! get off me !
help ! get off ! what 's happening ?
please , don 't . let go ! where are you taking him ?
leave him alone ! bax ! get your hands off him , you slags !
i watched the door all night to see if he 'd come out . yeah , me too .
shit , no ... come on . let 's not think the worst .
hiya . i think there 's more grub on the side . just help yourself .
we 've been worried sick . you 've been gone all night . what happened ?
i dunno ... weird . they asked me a bunch more questions and suddenly it was all , you know , tea and toast .
you should get some . come , please . oi !
sit .
fortunately for you ... .. we 're not actually interested in what you did over the last few days .
all we wanted to know was who you were financing . we weren 't financing anyone .
we were just trying to get home . with five million euros ?
we have at our disposal dna databases , forensic analysis , satellite imaging technology . if that doesn 't give us what we need , we employ enhanced interrogation techniques .
if we want to find out the truth , we do . and now , we have .
we made a mistake . it happens . so ...
just sign these and we 'll get you to the airport and on a flight .
hang on . does that mean that we can ... ? please don 't ask if you can keep the money .
do you want us to do anything for you , back home ?
little candle-lit vigil ?
coloured rubber wrist bands - " free mercedes . "
take care .
mrs peters . 101 bridge road , crawley . it 's my mum . just let her know i 'm all right .
you take care of yourself .
seriously ?
did you really think we were going to get out of there ?
two nights in . nah ... thought that was it .
what went through your mind ?
well , first of all , my kids ... carmen , and then just like , stupid stuff , like ... i thought i 'd never get to see united play again .
i kept thinking of my kids . kept seeing their little faces . then i thought about nina ....
i wouldn 't be there to tell them that that 's not what i 'm like . be honest , kid , you were worried about her finding your porno collection . nah , i don 't know .
they might wonder why four grown men went on holiday together , saying they were going to spain and actually ending up in morocco .
if anyone so much as mentions " bad luck , " they 're walking . be a long walk back , pal , we 've been driving for nearly an hour . haven 't seen so much as a camel .
he 's gone .
he 's not coming back , is he ?
two stay , two go and get help . shouldn 't we all go ? why ?
or stay ? we 'll double our chances if we split . halve them you mean .
i do . i do . i do .
i 'll go . come on . you two stay here , if the driver comes back , just all stay with the car , all right ?
do you believe in destiny , bax ? no .
so shut up .
fate then ?
rick , please . no destiny , no fate , no karma , no spells , no curses .
this is just a series of misunderstandings , ok ?
could have happened to anybody . no more , no less .
who 's ... ?
come on !
get in . you are about to be shot , get in !
bax , get in .
woods ! quinn ! hey !
- we had some disturbing intel . - well , if it 's bad news can you just lie to me ?
i 'd like to know what 's going on , please . a covert department of the cia , the special activities division has activated a kill contract on you . sorry ?
what are you talking about ? evidently , you 've intersected a line of narco-finance and ... wait .
your man in majorca ... .. has operated successfully for so long because he gives huge kickbacks to the american security services . what ?
he 's paying the cia to protect him ?
narco-finance is a major revenue stream - for american black ops . - like a five-year-old , please .
not really new news . why would they want to kill us ?
one of you tipped off the authorities in the uk . a contact inside customs and excise .
your man here retaliated by telling the special activities division you were about to blow their op wide open . so now they have to take you out . no , this ... this is crazy .
this goes higher than us . this kind of thing brings down governments . iran contra anyone ?
which is why removing you is an easy piece of damage limitation . they can 't just shoot four blokes who just happened to go on holiday together . under the aegis of " the global war on terror , " they can shoot anyone they like .
the cia ? no .
they 'd have tasked local contractors . so nothing can be linked back to them . you got lucky ...
but this isn 't going to go away . ok , let 's get practical , then . so what are the options ?
well , there must be something ?
right ... right - there may be a solution but we have to act now . like , this minute .
then i 'm afraid you 're on your own . how long would this be for ?
maybe for ever .
- we can never go home ?
- it 's the only offer on the table .
no , no , no , that 's ... that 's not an option .
no . i 'm going home and ... if you go back , you 'll be putting your families at risk as well .
ok , let me just see if this is even logistically possible .
stand up . get up .
we can do it . we have a scrambled phone link . you can each of you make one phone call home but you must not , under any circumstances , tell them where you are and what is happening .
amy ... yeah , i know , i 'm sorry that i haven 't rung .
listen to me for a second , love . nina ... just stop , just let me talk , darling , ok ?
right ... there 's no easy way of saying this , ok , so i 'm just going to say it straight out . i 'm not coming back .
if i 've only got one call , which one do i call ? you can 't make me choose . i need you to phone my folks ,
where are they ?
shit ... i want you to tell the girls that i love them both very much ... i don 't know how long .
.. because that is not what 's happened . i 've met someone .
oh , amy ... please , just tell the kids , ok , that it 's not because of them , i 'm sorry nina .
no , no , everything 's fine . it 's just ... i think i 'm going to stay out here a little longer .
what ?
well , what happened to your satellite dish ?
i can 't hear you rachel , say that again .
take care ?
yeah , ok . i will . you too .
fuck ... no , no , you 're right , i 'm sorry , i know i shouldn 't swear . dad , listen to me , ok ?
you 've been brilliant , dad .
yeah , just take care . yeah ... i love you , dad .
i know you all think it 's my fault , don 't you ? you think it 's my fault because i phoned the vat man .
it 's nobody 's fault , rick . it 's just ... i don 't know , the universe conspiring against us or something .
a fly saved my life . what ?
out in the desert . if it hadn 't been for that fly , i 'd have had my head blown off . and the weird thing was , we 'd met before .
any idea where we 're going yet ?
is that a don 't know , or won 't say ?
bax ?
what you going to call yourself ?
what do you mean ?
your name .
we can 't use our own names right ?
hey ... i 'm gonna be floyd . that 's what i 'm gonna call myself .
you can 't call yourself that . why ?
it 's a black name . is it ?
it 's like calling yourself ... everton or tyrell , or something . you can 't .
tony smith . my name 's tony ... smith .
why can 't i be tony smith ? you call yourself whatever you like , mate . sir tony smith if you want , mate .
if i was a girl , i 'd call myself ... .. well , hope . you could be bob hope . new hope .
new house .
jamie .... jamie kirk , then . blake ...
tony smith , adam newhouse , jamie kirk and ... .. blake hatch . hatch . welcome to your new fucking lives .
where are we ?
south africa .
we 're on the other side of the world . do they speak english here ?
uh ... i think so . what 's it like ?
i don 't know . this will all sort out , won 't it ?
eh ? a week from now , we 'll be in a pub in london , we 'll be laughing about this . some rand to get you through the first few weeks .
how do we get in touch with you ?
you don 't . right , ok . - how do we keep in touch ?
- you won 't be able to . it 's too dangerous . hang on a minute .
what happens if it 's safe for us , if it becomes safe for us to go home , to break cover ? how will we know that ?
as far as anyone else knows now , you don 't exist . that 's your best chance of surviving . if you want to stay alive , stay invisible .
the truth will come out though , won 't it ? in the end . ok , let 's go .
say your goodbyes . come on , move this thing along . come on , people .
take care of yourselves .
woody .
hey , we shouldn 't be on our own . listen , i know i said some things ... .. but you boys mean a lot to me , all right ? and you always will .
quinn , quinn , come on . guys , come on , we should stay together , yeah ? we 're a team now .
right , boys ... chin up . at least we 're still standing , eh ?
you 'll be all right , bax . what makes you say that ?
you 're smart . i 'm not that fucking smart .
good luck .
hey . what about if just me and him , we stick together ?
- it 'll be all right , won 't it ? - no . - listen , nobody has to know .
you 'll be all right . i can 't do this woody . yes , you can .
you 're strong , mate . you 're stronger than you think . no , i 'm not .
woods , let 's not do it , yeah ? you and me , we 'll stay together , yeah ?
woods ... woody ... woody , let me go with you , yeah ?
please , woody . woody , let me come with you , please . hey !
woody ... woody , i don 't want to be on my own ! woody , please .
woody , mate . don 't leave me , please . woody !
i know every disgraced politician , every gem smuggler , every high-stakes gambler and gold digger that come through those doors . why you never go away ?
you don 't even leave cape town . if you love her so much , why don 't you marry her ? yeah , why don 't you marry me and take me to england ?
your name isn 't newhouse is it ?
how dare you , and how dare you try and blackmail me !
help !
previously on siberia ... ( indistinct shouting )
a tiger !
a fucking tiger !
i couldn 't believe it .
it was like something a seven year old would tell me ...
" oh , i saw a tiger in the woods ... "
- what are you doing ?
- wondering what would do that to a tiger .
oh , hell .
it 's on fire ...
and it 's green ...
- what 's on fire ?
- the sky .
you know , there 's something about carolina .
i feel like i recognize her .
- fire in the woods , man .
- ( man ) got to get some water .
i told you this was a mistake !
that 's all we had , man .
that 's all we had .
does anyone recognize this ?
we found johnny 's shirt .
and it was full of food from the shed .
( johnny ) i get what it looks like .
i see that .
but i didn 't steal the food , and i didn 't burn down the shed .
someone obviously doesn 't like me , and they 're trying to set me up .
people weren 't taking too kindly me being at camp ' cause apparently i stole food from the shed and then burned it down .
someone framed me .
they wrapped my shirt around some food , hid it in the woods .
i don 't know who did it .
you know , frankly , i don 't really care anymore , you know ?
i don 't really need them anyways .
you know , obviously , i can take care of myself .
took them how long to build a fire ?
i did it in five minutes in the dark .
( daniel ) i can 't believe
johnny 's gonna just stay out in the woods .
that 's crazy .
and why shouldn 't he ?
after all the crap that he 's pulled ?
he 'll be fine .
and if he 's not , you got a better chance of winning .
and you can keep his bed .
i want to make it to the end , but i want to do it as a team , kind of like how neeko 's doing it , you know ?
can i tell you something ?
( daniel ) sure .
you 're a smart guy .
you know that neeko is a professional athlete ?
he plays game for living .
how about maybe he 's playing this game that he 's a very nice guy , everybody trusts him , just to win the game ?
have you ever thought about it ?
i don 't think you should trust him .
( sam ) can 't trust anybody .
guys ?
i get up early , and as soon as i open the door , i practically ran into this spear that 's stuck in the ground .
it felt like a threat .
let me see .
( woman ) what does it say ?
it says ... ( speaks russian )
( woman ) what is that ?
it means " get out . "
it 's just another thing to throw on the pile of what the hell 's going on here .
it 's a nice prop .
look at it .
it 's not real .
nice scare tactic .
they 're watching .
i 'm sure they 're loving this .
( woman ) why is it in front of our cabin and not yours ?
who wants you guys to get out ?
( man ) well , this is here on purpose .
that 's for sure .
it 's here on purpose .
it 's here for a reason .
you guys gonna be so gullible to fall for this , really ?
( daniel ) who else could 've left that spear ?
besides production , who could 've done it ?
we 're the only people out here .
aren 't we ?
♪
- are you okay ?
- i 'm fine .
i mean , aren 't you still scared ?
the spear this morning telling us to leave ?
that doesn 't scare you at all ?
i think , at this point , it 's just all mind games .
i miss home .
i miss my family .
i even miss my stupid ex-boyfriend .
this place is-- it 's getting to me .
i don 't know .
i 'm thinking about pushing the button .
i don 't want you to go .
you know what i mean ?
i think-- i think we can win this .
we just need to--
but i don 't need to stay .
i don 't understand why i 'm even staying .
i don 't need the money that badly .
i do .
annie .
( sam ) i 've been a lone wolf for a while , you know ?
i 've been on my own for a while .
i 'm probably , without knowing it , less lonely than i have been in a long time because i 'm interacting with people more often than i have in many years .
now i consider daniel a friend .
he 's a good kid .
if i had a son , i 'd be proud if he was like daniel .
what are you looking at ?
- just watching those two .
- mm-hmm .
( daniel ) i don 't want to overstep my bounds , you know .
i don 't know how she feels about me , and so i 'm just kind of--
i 'm taking it slow , but at the same time , it 's really hard ' cause i really want to , you know , see where this is gonna go .
i don 't know .
at the same time , i don 't want to get hurt .
don 't worry .
she knows you exist .
how would i really get her to ?
i don 't know , like ...
get her to what ?
like me like me .
you can 't get her to like you .
either she does or she doesn 't .
you know ?
( laughs )
how beautiful is it ?
this is so nice .
_
why not ?
_
( laughs )
i 'm sorry .
i 'm being naughty .
it 's beautiful in , though .
_
you must be hot .
come on .
_
- no good ... _
- no one 's here .
- it 's trouble .
no one 's here .
i 'm not gonna tell anyone .
you want to come .
- oh , yeah ?
_
you 'll thank me once you 're in here .
it 's beautiful .
_
careful .
_
i 'm gonna film us .
_
( laughs ) it 's a great idea .
( laughs )
you promise you 'll erase it ?
_
- promise me ?
- i promise .
good .
annie ?
wait , annie .
you shouldn 't be walking out here alone .
it 's not safe .
_
what are you talking about ?
come on , it 's not safe .
stop . wait .
don 't be like this .
be like what ?
look , i-- ( sighs )
it 's not the same thing for me , okay ?
i 'm not going back to a life or a job that i like or family or friends or even an ex-boyfriend , and i get that you 're sad about that .
but you 're forgetting about who 's here for you right now , and you 're turning your back on me .
no , i 'm not .
( annie ) i like her .
it 's been a while since i 've been with anybody , but i--
we get along so well .
i just feel like a dumbass now .
i mean , she 's probably not gonna talk to me for the rest of the time , if she does stay .
- hey .
- ( irene ) hey .
- there you are .
- ( irene ) how 's it going ?
good .
i just wanted to talk to you .
uh-huh ?
um , so , victoria 's gone .
um , i 'm just wondering what 's going on with her bed .
oh , it 's-- well , it 's free right now .
so no one would mind if i moved in ?
um ... yeah , yeah .
i mean , i don 't mind .
i don 't know what the other girls other think , but it 's good with me .
( esther ) awesome .
all right , i 'll go grab my things .
it 's not that i didn 't have fun with the boys .
i don 't know .
i just feel like my time there is done .
it 's served its purpose , and i want to--
i want to get to know the girls a bit better .
- ( miljan ) hey .
- hey .
- ( miljan ) what are you doing ?
- i 'm leaving .
you mean the show ?
( esther ) ( laughs ) no , you idiot .
i 'm gonna move into victoria 's old bed .
wait .
why ?
why ?
because it 's free .
( miljan ) i know , but i thought you liked it here with me .
you said we are great roommates .
yes , we were , and thank you for letting me stay .
just , i don 't know .
i want to be with the girls now .
come on , esther .
don 't you think we should team up ?
( esther ) ( laughs )
we are both smarter than everyone else here .
we can win this thing-- together .
ohh , i like your style .
i will think about it .
but hold on .
hold on .
hold on .
i was just thinking that we could have something ... ( esther ) you thought what ?
that we could get romantic a little bit ?
( esther ) ( laughs )
( miljan ) don 't laugh .
really ?
i don 't do romance .
look , we 're playing a game .
( miljan ) what do you mean ?
( esther ) i 'm playing a game-- for money .
i don 't do romance , and i 'm not playing a dating game .
i 'm sorry .
fuck you , bitch !
fuck you , bitch !
you 're not going anywhere .
get the fuck off me !
( miljan ) i 'm kidding .
( laughing ) i was just kidding , esther .
i 'm just kidding .
esther .
( esther ) don 't you fucking touch me again .
( miljan ) come on ! i 'm just-
- i was just kidding !
( esther ) i think i was in shock .
i-i don 't know .
it happened so quickly .
but he grabbed me here , pushed me up against the bunk , and then he backed off .
( miljan ) esther is a player .
we all know that .
and i played with her , too .
so she was on the way out .
i just pushed her a little bit on the bed , just jokingly , like pretending that i 'm like scaring her .
" you 're gonna stay here , " or something .
she just , like , freaked out .
she pushed me away .
she 's like , " don 't talk to me like that . "
stormed out , like mad .
and i was just telling her , " i 'm joking .
you know me . i always joke around .
i was just joking with you . "
i didn 't get it , seriously .
she just freaked out , and it was just a pure joke .
what are you showing me ?
it was right here .
( carolina ) are you sure ?
( neeko ) big huge carcass .
guts hanging out and everything .
look .
look at what ?
the blood ?
it could 've been anything .
it could 've been a bird . it could 've been a deer .
( neeko ) why would i make this up ?
why would i lie ?
there was a huge-- there was a huge tiger there .
i guess they took it .
the producers took it .
the producers ?
i think she thinks that i could 've been trying to scare her , play a sick joke on her .
i was kind of a bit shocked because i didn 't think she saw me as that kind of person .
for all i know , johnny took it .
( carolina ) johnny took it ?
he probably dragged it off into there and hid it or something .
i don 't know .
( carolina ) oh , now johnny does everything ?
not only do we have to worry about the producers playing mind games with us , we got to worry about that guy .
hopefully he 's done us all a favor and gone and pushed the button to get out of here .
i don 't think he 's as bad as you think .
why are you always defending him ?
why are you always defending him ?
i 'm telling you that guy 's dangerous .
you need to watch yourself !
i 'm kind of baffled where it 's gone , you know , ' cause this thing was pretty big , you know .
it would 've taken a lot of force or something pretty hefty to get it out of there , and there was no trail .
there was no kind of like a trail of where it could 've been dragged to .
it 's like it was almost picked up and gone .
got some traps set up along this way somewhere .
i found some deer trails i scouted earlier .
hope they catch something .
the first night in the woods by myself was pretty awesome , actually .
had a nice little fire .
weather was nice .
you know , wrapped up .
it was nice being on my own .
it 's what i wanted to do originally , too , is , you know , be by myself , take care of myself , do my own thing , and i got that , so pretty content .
what the hell did this , man ?
this thing 's ...
i mean , it , obviously , it ripped the deer while it was standing here .
it was strong enough to rip it off-- rip the , like , rip its bone in half .
( crack )
what do you want ?
what are you doing ?
( johnny ) i 'm trying to catch some food , but something got to it before me , it looks like .
what do you want ?
i just came to try to convince you to come back .
( johnny ) try to convince me to come back , to the camp ?
yeah , i don 't think it 's safe for you to be out here .
i think it 's safer here than being back at camp where a bunch of people don 't like me thanks to you , making those wild accusations .
just , whatever happened , i don 't think it 's safe for you to stay out here .
well , you know what ?
i really don 't need you trying to be nice to me .
i 'll be fine on my own , okay ?
i can take care of myself .
y 'all try taking care of yourselves , too , all right ?
( carolina ) okay , fine .
if that 's how you want to be , then fine .
( johnny ) fine .
nah , that 's-- that 's not good enough .
that ain 't good enough .
( daniel ) hey , irene .
hey , dan .
whatcha doing ?
collecting some acorns .
- oh .
- yeah .
if you mash them up , you can make like a paste and make a pancake out of it .
- really ?
- yeah .
is it-- does it taste good ?
i think so .
you want me to help ?
oh , sure .
that 'd be great . yeah .
they 're kind of scattered all over .
daniel is a really , really nice , really sweet person , and he has such a gentle-- a very gentle spirit ,
i guess you can say .
hey .
it 's a siberian squill .
( irene ) i 'm not really big on flowers .
why not ?
well , you know , they 're pretty , but it 's kind of odd , the whole idea of someone giving someone a flower ' cause it 's like , " oh , you know , i like you , so let me give you something that 's dying . "
it never really made sense to me .
( chuckles )
something more permanent would be nice , you know , even a rock would be better .
( daniel ) she 's got so much complexity to her , you know ?
i find out something new about her every day , it seems like , and it 's a pretty big thing that i would 've never expected out of her .
it 's ... ( chuckles )
she 's just-- she 's amazing .
( both chuckle )
where are we ?
i can 't find the path .
we 're lost .
- we 're not lost .
- no , we 're lost .
i don 't know where we 're going .
( miljan ) in the middle of the wood , very close to the river ,
i found this really weird-looking tree .
i mean , it wasn 't a tree .
it was something different .
it had a face shape .
it had hair .
what ?
my name is miljan .
it 's really nice to meet you . ( chuckles )
what is your name ?
ogdee ?
( laughs )
this is my friend ogdee .
we go way back , man .
( laughs )
he 's so bad .
i spoke to it .
we had a little conversation .
ogdee is my old friend from high school .
( laughs )
i 'm kidding .
- ( man ) esther .
esther .
- what ?
( esther ) hey .
where have you been ?
out .
out ?
where do you go all day , anyway ?
( whispering ) okay .
i can 't believe you got us so lost .
we 're not lost .
yes , we are .
where are we ?
do you know where we are ?
we 're in siberia .
not funny .
oh , god !
what is that ?
did you hear that ?
i heard it .
come on .
there might be something out here .
come on .
oh !
oh , god !
what are you doing out here ?
sorry .
i 'm going to get water .
where are you going ?
home-- where the hell is it ?
that way .
why is she being such a bitch ?
why are you here , by the way , alone ?
no reason .
uh-huh .
that 's suspicious .
( annie ) shut up , miljan .
( chuckles )
( neeko ) guys , have you seen carolina ?
( sam ) no .
she hasn 't come back .
you mean she 's not back yet ?
she 's not back .
i have no idea where she is .
i haven 't seen her .
you do know she 's out there with johnny ?
yeah , tell me about it .
i know .
well , i don 't know about you , but i feel like i should go and look for her .
i don 't-- i don 't feel comfortable with her with johnny .
( sam ) before it gets too late , i think we should .
i 'm game , yeah .
( neeko ) - you 're gonna come with me ?
- yeah .
( miljan ) gentlemen .
where the hell were you ?
i was in the woods .
have you seen carolina ?
( neeko ) she 's out there with johnny .
( miljan ) oh , she 'll be fine , guys .
- come on .
- are you serious ?
( miljan ) yes .
they 're probably having sex or something .
oh , you 're a funny guy .
don 't be naive . you didn 't notice the chemistry they had ?
( neeko ) hey , guys , listen .
i 'm gonna look for her .
i don 't know about you .
just sitting here talking .
( miljan ) hey , it 's dark outside .
( rumbling )
oh , fuck !
( neeko ) get on the bed .
get onto the bed !
the bed ?
( miljan ) oh , my god .
what is this ?
the cab started shaking ...
ran outside , and the sky this just this odd color that i 've never seen in my life , and i 'm thinking it can 't be the show doing this because that 's way out of their powers and their control .
what is it ?
it 's like-- it 's like the sky 's on fire .
what ?
it 's like the sky 's on fire .
( daniel ) the sky went from dark to light , and it looked like it was on fire , just like victoria said .
if this is all part of the game , it 's beyond me at this point .
i don 't understand how they could pull it off .
( sam ) i feel like i 'm on another planet .
i feel like i walked into some kind of a dream or a nightmare , and nobody-- nobody has any answers .
i don 't have an answer .
i could sit here all day long and just-- it 's way above my pay scale .
- is it moving ?
- it just keeps moving .
carolina never came back today , did she ?
( woman ) yeah .
where-- where are they ?
( miljan ) she 's still in the woods-- the forest .
well , this can 't stop us .
we still have to find her .
we can 't leave her out there .
we better go now .
we 're just gonna go look for her-- me and sam , daniel , miljan as well .
oh , my god .
carolina ?
carolina .
are you okay ?
( indistinct shouting )
( woman ) what happened ?
oh , my god .
carolina !
- what happened ?
are you okay ?
- are you okay ?
then we see carolina stumbling towards the girls ' cabin , and the girls go rushing over to her .
are you hurt somewhere ?
- ( sam ) what happened ?
- ( woman ) look at all the blood .
what happened ?
she 's bleeding .
guys , don 't , don 't-- don 't go to her .
oh , my god , look at her arm .
look at her arm .
( sam ) what happened to you ?
you 're okay .
( neeko ) carolina , what happened ?
( daniel ) carolina shows up , and she 's battered and disoriented .
she couldn 't even speak .
she 's trembling .
( carolina ) i don 't ...
she doesn 't remember .
- ( woman ) you don 't remember ? - ( carolina cries )
( sam ) what do you remember ?
( natalie ) she didn 't know what was going on .
she was saying she couldn 't even , like , remember what she 'd been doing out there .
she was just talking nonsense , and it was really jolting to see her come back like that .
_
( woman ) you were with john ?
- ( sam ) and what happened ?
- ( woman ) where is he ?
what were you doing with johnny ?
get her some water .
get her some help .
( neeko ) carolina , were you with johnny ?
( sam ) she said she was .
what were you doing with johnny ?
( neeko ) she said the name " johnny . "
at that point , i just , you know , lost it .
listen to me .
listen to me .
listen to me .
( neeko ) for what ?
here , just come here .
come here .
i want to say something to you .
- what ?
- listen to me !
it 's important .
you got to make sure .
you look at his hands .
( neeko ) okay .
his hands are a tell-tale sign , okay ?
his hands will tell you if he did something .
( daniel ) what are you doing ?
where are you going ?
stay here with the girls .
stay here with the girls !
( neeko ) i 'm not wasting any more time with this guy .
everyone wants to keep him around , thinking ,
" oh , yeah , he 'll turn around and be a good guy . "
no , i don 't think so .
i 'm not gonna lay around waiting for him to come stab me in the back .
- she 's been through a lot .
- yeah .
we 're gonna look after you , okay ?
don 't worry .
( esther ) we don 't know where johnny is .
carolina sort of-- she couldn 't say much , but she said that she was-- they were fighting-- her and johnny were fighting .
and then , now she looks like this , so johnny should be probably fearing for his life right now because sam and neeko went after him .
let 's just keep moving .
( rustling )
move .
move .
_
( rustling continues )
the whole walking through the woods and hearing noises coming from places that , you know--
we stop and we look , and there 's nothing there .
it 's just this whole atmosphere that everything just feels like you 're being watched , you know .
whether , you know , whether you 're in the woods or in the cabin , you always feel like something is watching you , and the past two nights ,
i haven 't slept very well , you know .
so i 'm just-- you know , you 're always looking over your shoulder .
you always think something 's there , and , like , the whole thing with the sky now ...
i don 't know .
( animal screeches )
well , he 's obviously around here somewhere .
( rustling )
yes .
you keep saying " he , " " he . "
look how thick the brush is here .
if there 's somebody around here , we 'd see them .
we hear other things .
all of a sudden , something goes flying .
i think we should be talking more in the sense of " what . "
i 'll go see if the water 's boiled .
thank you .
( natalie ) i don 't want to die .
i didn 't ever expect that that would be a possibility on this show , and every day that i 'm here ,
i feel like i 'm an idiot for staying , that i am gonna end up like tommy .
( cries )
i don 't deal well with-- abuse is not something that ...
i can handle right now .
i 'm scared .
( daniel ) and johnny was already on the outs with the group for stealing food .
i just-- how could he do that to her ?
it didn 't make sense .
she 's such a nice lady .
( footsteps )
johnny .
hey .
what did you do ?
- huh ?
- what did you do to carolina ?
i don 't know what you 're talking about .
what do you mean you don 't know what i 'm talking about ?
- what 'd you do to her ?
- i didn 't--
she 's all cut up and shit .
i don 't-
- i don 't know .
i ...
what 's wrong with you ?
i don 't know . i just-
- i kind of came to .
i was walking around , and ...
i don 't know .
i was- - i saw her .
you saw her where ?
you got to tell me what happened .
we were in the woods , and ...
i don 't really-- i don 't really remember .
i get approached by daniel , and basically started accusing me of hurting carolina .
i didn 't know what to say .
( natalie ) what did you to do her ? !
the last thing she remembers is getting in a fight with you , so you can 't come back here and tell me that you didn 't touch her !
i don 't .
( natalie ) then what happened to her ?
i don 't know .
that 's not a very good answer right now , man .
i don 't-- trust me .
that 's not a very good answer .
( indistinct shouting in distance )
hey .
you hear that ?
at the camp .
let 's go .
i don 't know .
are you serious ?
you don 't know ?
you 're such a scumbag .
oh , what ?
so she just fell down and ended up that way ?
are you kidding me ?
i was in a complete haze .
i had no recollection .
i was like blacked out , like i drank too much .
( daniel ) he doesn 't look like he knows what 's going on .
( johnny ) i don 't .
- then what happened to her ?
- ( johnny ) i don 't know .
i don 't know .
( woman ) you were together , weren 't you ?
- you said that .
- shit !
neeko !
neeko !
( indistinct shouting )
( daniel ) guys , he doesn 't know !
( neeko )
- motherfucker !
( daniel )
- come on !
stop it !
- ( carolina ) stop !
stop it !
- ( neeko ) come on !
stop it !
neeko , stop it !
he didn 't do it !
carolina starts screaming , " it 's not him .
he didn 't do it . "
stop it !
what do you mean ?
you said you don 't remember .
you said you don 't remember .
( neeko ) you 're a dead man .
you 're a fucking dead man .
( daniel ) listen .
listen .
hey , hey .
hey !
calm down .
listen .
- what happened ?
- ( johnny ) i don 't know .
talk to me .
i don 't know .
johnny doesn 't know anything ?
he doesn 't remember anything .
it was just her and him in the forest .
i know that .
i know that .
i saw it in his eyes , okay ?
all i remember is i talked to her .
we were arguing .
and then i-i came here , and i started getting accused , and i don 't even know what the fuck is going on .
( sam ) if we caught him in the woods , he would 've been dead .
when i saw that look in his eyes ,
i just felt that i needed to take a step back .
remember the way she came into camp ?
he 's got the same look on his face .
( johnny ) does she remember anything ?
( woman ) show us your hands .
( woman ) ( gasps )
( natalie ) oh , yeah .
i 've seen that before .
( woman ) what 's that from ?
( sam ) nothing 's making sense here .
and just to be angry and become a bunch of animals--
we can 't go killing each other .
we 're still human beings .
( hiss )
( talking indistinctly )
( birds chirping )
i don 't like things that i can 't explain and that i don 't have at least some sort of control over .
the sky changing color and looking like fire-- the producers , the show can 't do that .
we 're talking supernatural stuff now .
regardless of everything else , that 's real , and that scared the hell out of me .
( johnny ) it seems like everybody at camp was convinced that i was the person that hurt her .
i 've never hit a woman in my life .
i don 't know why i would .
i don 't remember anything , but ...
i can 't say that i didn 't ' cause i don 't--
i don 't know what happened .
but i know in my heart i wouldn 't do that .
( carolina ) i don 't remember anything .
all i remember is that i was ... with--
went to get johnny .
he was in the woods .
i found him , and i ...
it 's all one big blur , like one big blackout .
i have all these marks on my body , and my shirt is broken , and i don 't remember .
i don 't understand .
so you 're telling me this is real .
( sabina ) yes .
it looks like it 's native , handmade .
it looks like it 's just a prop to me .
well , if it 's a prop , it 's really well-made ' cause you see the barbs .
they 're curved .
that 's exactly how it should look .
this is ox .
it 's real ox .
and it 's balanced for throwing .
it just looks perfect .
it 's your choice to believe in it or not , but this is real , so ...
i don 't have to deal with lies in figuring out what is true , what is not .
i have to know the environment i 'm in .
i have to know what 's out there in order to protect myself and survive .
look at this .
so , i found this symbol that is really strange .
it has four lines and little triangles on the ends .
then i found another one and another one , and i realized it 's a path .
i should follow them .
at the end , it was very close to the settlement .
i found the last one .
and i found this box .
it was a metal box .
i opened it , and it was a book .
i didn 't understand anything because it was in a different language .
i would assume it 's russian because it 's cyrillic letters .
( miljan ) in the middle of me looking at it , somebody was watching at me .
it was a person .
he 's staring at me .
and he just disappeared in a second .
so there are people out there .
hey .
i was just gonna try and make things better , and , like , apologize , and just wanted to let her know that i didn 't , you know ,
i didn 't want to screw anything up or make anything awkward for her .
i guess i was in a weird mood , and i just want to apologize because i don 't want to make you feel uncomfortable or anything , because i 'm really glad you 're--
( natalie ) when i realized what annie 's real feelings were for me ,
i just thought ...
" i 'm sort of open to love in any form right now . "
so i kissed her .
( chuckles )
which i kind of surprised myself at , to be honest .
( laughs )
don 't worry about it .
hey .
hey .
can i have a seat ?
how are you feeling ?
i 'm okay .
you ?
i wanted to go check on her to see how she was doing ' cause i knew she had scratches and stuff on her , and she was sure freaked out like i was .
( carolina ) do you remember anything from last night ?
no .
i don 't remember a thing .
i don 't remember anything either .
but i know you didn 't hurt me .
i would never hurt you .

( johnny ) can i ask you something , though ?
why 'd you set me up ?
with the shed and the food ?
she couldn 't even look me in the eye .
and i was like , " well ... "
i was like , " it tells me all i need to know , "
so i was like-- got the hell out of there .
johnny .
johnny .
( spanish ) stop , please .
johnny , wait for me .
- give me a break . ( spanish ) oh , my god . - ( daniel ) hey .
i know that .
i know that .
- johnny .
- i know that .
you 're an actress .
she said , like , this slogan .
like , " i know that .
i know that from somewhere . "
and then it just-- the light bulb went off .
yeah , that 's like your slogan .
she 's that actress from that show that--
i 'm like , " that 's how i know you . "
i didn 't want to do that .
i didn 't want-
- i asked them .
you didn 't want to do what ?
i didn 't want to burn it down .
i didn 't want to set you up .
they told me to .
who 's they ?
the producers .
so you 're-- you 're helping the show ?
- narrator : previously on ...
i 'm doing this pretty big pilot .
writing , directing , producing , starring in .
don 't even think about putting me on the call sheet if you 're gonna have wallace fennel doing any of that pussy shit .
ryan , baby , can i be in it ?
uh , where do you think you 're gonna find an asian guy who 's gonna let you beat him up ?
- uh , 28.22 .
- what 's that ?
it 's the ghost of beaver past , son !
oh , i 'm always happy to lend a hand , or voice , in my case , when it 's a special project and a dear friend is at the helm .
i mean , look around . this is a labor of love for everyone involved .
okay , does that about do it ?
you know , i 'd like to try one more , if that 's okay .
um , this time really hit the words " special " and " dear . "
you know , special project for my dear friend .
ok , maybe this time you can just riff a little bit about how i inspire you as a performer and a human being .
okay , you have got all of my scripted dialogue plus about ten takes of that making-of bullshit , you fuzzy little prick , and that is all you get .
ooh , i can feel the vibrations from your throaty timbre deep within my loins .
[ deep voice ] i bet the ladies love it .
your mother did .
voice-over actors , man . i 'm telling you . they 're so high maintenance .
let me let you in on a little secret .
it 's just talking .
a total boob could do it .
dick : first weevil , then keith .
danger now lurks around every corner , but so do i.
all i wanted was a nice weekend of sun and fun at my buddy 's funeral .
but now death followed me around like a hungry dog .
and that dog wasn 't the only thing looking for a bone .
dick : i guess what they say is true .
no lock in the world could keep a thirsty chick from a tall drink of water .
is that what they say ?
they do now .
got a name ?
- yes . it ...
- it doesn 't matter .
- can i ask you a question ?
- you just did .
ask me another one .
people everywhere are dying to the left and to the right .
the killer is still out there , but you remain as cool as a cucumber .
i didn 't hear a question .
how do you do it , dick casablancas ?
oh , you 're about to find out .
some may say it 's crass to take advantage of an emotionally vulnerable woman .
but those people are probably ugly .
what i just performed was a public service , like picking up trash at the beach or not farting on an airplane .
this was grief counseling , dick-style .
and what about my grief ?
if you prick me , do i not bleed ?
scratch that . i ain 't got time to bleed .
beaver : covering all the angles , aren 't you ?
oh , yeah , she 's super flexible .
don 't you worry , bro .
this case-solving factory , it 's running 24-7 , okay ?
i 'm gonna find your killer .
i heard about keith mars . that 's a shame .
wait , is he , um ... ?
down ... ? no , no .
he 's ...
but , you know , you hear things .
- hear anything about duncan ? - mm-mm .
you know , i 'm starting to wonder if his death was accidental after all .
he 's the sole heir to kane software 's 3d printing patents , worth billions .
that 's something i call motive .
makes sense to me .
do you have any suspects ?
negative .
i can 't think of anyone who would want
duncan , weevil and keith all dead .
well , every case is a puzzle , dick , but with the top of the box missing .
no picture of what it 's supposed to look like to guide you .
you just have to figure out how to put it together one piece at a time .
truth , bro , but time ... that 's exactly what i 'm running out of .
well , what 's the fastest way to solve a puzzle quickly ?
start with the corners .
you ask a friend for help .
ask a friend . mm .
looking good . i assume .
hey , i hate to bother you at a time like this , but , um , i need your help .
i 'm at duncan 's memorial service weekend getaway thing and ...
well , you know what , just get here as soon as you can .
oh , and , uh , sorry about your dad and all .
yes , i hired a dialect coach for my mexican lines .
i just think it 's really important , especially in television , to respectfully represent other cultures .
it 's gonna take more than a knife to slow me down .
yeah , like a gun .
yeah , a gun would probably do it .
[ dubbed in deep voice ] then you 'd better saddle up , cowboy .
this is your last ride .
you are not without skill .
- where did you study your craft ?
- the streets .
that was the name of my dojo i went to .
it was in the strip mall by my high school .
allow me to impart another lesson !
you fight honorably , dick-san .
but i fight to win .
what is that ?
why 'd you kill duncan , weevil and keith ?
who do you work for ?
i work for ... ow !
who sent you ?
spondoolie .
who 's behind this , wiedman ?
y ... you know .
you 've always known .
no , i don 't know .
that 's why i 'm punching you out .
wait .
- veronica .
- you 're too late .
she 's already dead .
because you brought her here .
do it .
do it .
do it !
you 're not even worth it .
so , christopher , were you excited when , uh , ryan asked you to be a part of this ?
who 's ryan ?
ryan hansen . the director .
the guy you did your death scene with ? ah .
i 've been in this game a while .
i 've played presidents , cops , villains , you name it .
i was on walker , texas ranger .
it 's a job .
i show up , i do the work , collect a check .
man : except here . the check part i mean .
come again ?
well , nobody 's getting paid .
it 's a microbudget .
veronica mars . just who i was looking for .
i 'm just here for dick .
i bet you are .
but you 'll have to settle for this .
are you okay ?
i think so .
recognize , bitch .
do you know what time it is ?
it 's about motherfucking time , that 's what time it is .
get your ass some wallace !
- narrator : previously on ...
- veronica .
- you 're too late .
- i 'm just here for dick .
- i bet you are .
but you 'll have to settle for this !
- are you okay ?
- i think so .
recognize , bitch .
oh , my god , wallace . you just shot madison .
to the untrained eye , perhaps .
that 's not madison .
this is celeste kane , wife of jake kane , mother of duncan kane , whose funeral we were at today .
and , oh , my god . she 's the mystery woman .
how 'd you know ?
three words . contour of vagina .
i know madison 's like the palm of my hand .
add that to kane software 's 3d technology ... heh . what did you tell me ?
we 've only scratched the surface of what these machines can do .
face masks so perfect ... can fool almost anyone .
suddenly , pieces have fallen into place .
powers of de-dick-tion . what ?
i never ever could 've put all that together .
that 's okay . you know what ?
someday you will get there .
but you are adorable , and that counts for something .
and as for you , now this is the time where you confess and tell us why you did it .
because they ruined my life !
weevil sullied my daughter .
keith , he accused my husband of murder .
and veronica , she spirited away my little duncan .
they all deserved to die , and i would 've gotten away with it
- if it hadn 't been for ... - us meddling kids ?
i already said . - vagina contour .
- no . this black kid .
- bitch .
- that 's no black kid .
whitey say what ?
you 're no killer , old friend .
please . don 't .
anybody want a donut ?
extraordinary .
is that really you ?
in the flesh .
don 't hate me .
my prodigal son .
duncan must 've figured out that his mom was planning his fake funeral so that she could gather all of her old enemies there so that she could murder them .
he then flew back from australia so he could save veronica 's life .
way ahead of you , ace .
hello , old friend .
yeah , i know it 's a little bit of a strange choice for mercer the serial rapist from season three to be recast as duncan kane from seasons one and two .
normally that kind of thing would bump me as an actor , but ... i just got to make out with veronica mars !
i can 't believe this shit . my own son shot me .
pipe down , mom . i winged you .
you 'll live .
why did he go through the trouble to look like wallace ?
he needed a fall guy .
the police are picking up the real wallace as we speak .
- airtight plan .
- yeah , again , though , i 've been shot .
so if somebody could call an ambulance ... i don 't know , maybe help - slow the bleeding .
- you 're not gonna stand in the way of our love again , mom !
don 't you get it ? i 'm not your perfect son .
i never was !
veronica , you said you wanted to take some time for your career ...
right on .
well , my work here is done .
spondoolie .
go , dick !
go , dick !
it 's almost like it 's too good , right ?
micro-budget just gave you a macro boner , am i right ?
i ... i 'm afraid it 's gonna be a pass .
yeah , look , our demo , you know , they 're , uh , they 're ... they 're a bit more accustomed to , um ... you know , a certain level of ...
competence .
you know , jeanie in reception can give you partial validation .

- at your age !
- shut up shut up , you idiot
you 're getting on my tits
was the drive ok ?
not too much puking ?
go on
you , move
no . you stay there
what are you doing ?
you 're out of your minds fuck you , laeti
you 're nothing to us , now
like sandrine ?
this should convince her mum
series created by alexandra clert the girls are on the wanted list of every station in paris
whatever happens , they 're going to need money
we 've tapped their families ' phones in case they call
we 've dealt with the handbags and this ?
what was it doing in the squat ?
we have something on laetitia ribeiro 's phone
she went to fetch her boss 's kid . they 're not back
her boss is losing it and keeps calling laetitia
- she 's not answering ?
let 's go
her friend said she saw it happen outside the school
- they both got in a van ? - i don 't know anyone with a van
- did her friend see who was driving ?
- no
- do you have her number ? - of course
laetitia always tells me if she 's running late
she knows i worry
thanks
have you ever seen her ?
- i saw her with laetitia
- when ?
at lunchtime .
who is she ?
- call the office for back-up - ok
so , this is charlotte , eight years old
she and laetitia got in a white van on rueetienne marcel go and meet tintin and gilou there
check cctv and comb the area ok .
nico , you go that way . tom , come with me
still here ?
i couldn 't just drop you in it . i 'll leave once we find the girl
- but your new job ... - it can wait
nobody else wants it , anyway
how 's it going ?
a little girl was abducted . it can 't get much worse
- josèphine , i don 't understand - what don 't you understand ?
ziani was meant to go to prison .
that was what we agreed
the magistrate disagreed . i wasn 't going to fight to send him to prison
the magistrate agreed with me . it was machard who did this
and you knew he would . that 's why you made the deal with me and you knew he would .
that 's why you made the deal with me
you think i 'm in league with machard ?
i got over pierre 's death by staying true to my principles and so , it seems , did you
your honour ... this case was a welcome distraction for us both we were both doing our jobs .
we owe each other nothing
marianne ?
a fax came from jaulin 's lawyer
the children 's judge doesn 't want him to see his son
i 'll deal with it
thank you
so , ziani is the one who just got off ? - and djibril works with him ?
- yeah .
he 's onto a good thing
- where are the cars ? - here
in djibril 's garage he 's fitted them with libyan embassy plates
worth 500 grand , in all
they go to marseille in three days , then by boat to libya
djibril will regret not having us as allies
he 's going to regret more than that
gilou , it 's me , cindy
i wanted to tell you .
i can 't stop thinking about yesterday
i loved it , i want you to take me
call me
- escoffier it 's none of our beeswax
it 's our chance to get back at cid
we 'll do our job properly if anyone goes down , it 's djibril
yes ?
- hello , marianne - hello
superintendent it 's been too long
if you read the newspaper , you 'll know how things are going if you 're worried about tarek ziani , perhaps i can put your mind at rest
go on
ziani is under investigation ... for trafficking luxury cars between france and libya
we were led to him by a well-known felon , djibril mérini
he steals top-end cars . we 've been tailing him for weeks
he supplies ziani from a garage in the 20th arrondissement
then he fits the cars with diplomatic number plates
the cars go to marseille on the 16th
then they leave for tripoli
and what are you going to do ?
request a preliminary investigation ... and search the property
should i wait until you 're on duty ?
make sure ziani 's name isn 't mentioned ... or the prosecutor 's office will kick up a fuss
don 't you mind that ziani got off ?
yes , but i don 't take it personally . we can 't win every case
you 'll have to excuse me . my husband just got promoted
give him my congratulations
don 't get involved with ziani again . forget him
move on
yes . laure ?
abducted ? who ?
i 'll come and see you
is that the van ?
right time , right colour .
but we can 't read the plate
- how old is the girl ? - eight
and what do we know about laetitia ribeiro ?
she grew up with the other girls in the gang she got five years for arson , along with karen hoarau , or " oz "
she was released on parole a few weeks ago
her placement was going well ... her boss said she took the job seriously
then , she abducts a child
we don 't know if oz convinced laetitia to do it ... or if laetitia had the idea herself
i 'm sure you 'll agree that the little girl is our first priority
i 'll be back
laure , i meant to ask you ... you remember djibril mèrini , who helped us to find blanco ?
are you going after him or not ?
not him in particular . why ?
the crime unit wants to bring him in for questioning
the crime unit ?
on what grounds ?
car theft
i wanted to make sure you weren 't planning to arrest him
i 'll check , but i don 't think so
if you hear anything about the girl , don 't hesitate to call me
goodbye , chief inspector
- all right ?
- yeah
i don 't get it ... they still haven 't dealt with my complaint it 's been three weeks
that happens sometimes
is it because djibril is a grass ?
that doesn 't mean he can beat up his girl
i don 't want to be his girl
what did they say about your complaint ?
- did you hear me ?
- yeah
i don 't care about djibril
i want to be with you
sort things out with him , first
that 's what the complaint is for
yeah , but i can 't get involved with you ... if things aren 't clear between you
you weren 't so fussy back at your place
exactly , and i want you to come back there
- but all in good time
oh , no . what is it ?
the crime unit wants to arrest djibril for car theft how do you know ?
it 's roban 's case . he came and told me
- did you tell him he 's our grass ?
- of course not
do you want djibril to go down ?
rather him than us
brèmont is doing us a favour , in a way
sooner or later , djibril would have stabbed us in the back
we never even saw those two cayennes he asked for he probably kept them for himself
is that going to be a problem ?
no , it just feels wrong i don 't think it 's right for another unit to nick him
but you 'd shag his girl
no way
what are you doing ? they sent a ransom message to the girl 's mother
" 100 grand and we 'll let her live "
i don 't have it i can get 20,000 but i don 't have 100,000
we can negotiate with them we 'll do everything we can to find charlotte
she 's asthmatic
if she gets worried or anxious , she 'll have an asthma attack
i always put an inhaler in her bag ... but what if she 's lost it ?
the girls will call about the money
so stay here with us we 'll help you to talk to them
i could borrow the money from friends
- we 're not going to pay them
- what do you mean ?
right now , they need charlotte ... but if you pay we don 't know what they might do
but if we don 't pay , will i ever see her again ?
we never pay ransoms otherwise , everyone would start doing it
i don 't believe this
quiet , please
it 's thanks to one woman that i 'm here tonight
she gave me the thing that every man values most dearly ... his liberty
ms karlsson , allow me to kiss you
are you free next week ?
come to beirut
i 'll think about it
ok , i 'll be back in two minutes
if you meet his friends , you 'll have no end of work
they 're all the same
i want to work here , not in beirut
maurice has his faults , but he 's a man of his word
you 'll get your place at the firm
he has a lot to gain by hiring you
- you want another ? - yes
joséphine , can i talk to you for a minute ?
you know that when we first met , i didn 't think very highly of you
yes , i noticed that
but now , let 's talk about the future
we need someone like you on the board of directors ... who isn 't afraid to make difficult decisions when they arise
what do you think ?
i don 't know what to say
i never expected this
i should tell you right now ... that if you accept , it comes at a price
we need you to vote with us at the next board meeting
what for ?
to dismiss edelman
you want to dismiss edelman ?
why ?
ziani isn 't the first client we 've nearly lost because of him
the next board meeting is tomorrow ... at 3 : 00pm
look , i identified the van
it was stolen from a bread company two days ago
- put out a call . and gilou ...
- yeah ?
i 've been thinking
what 's going on with cindy ?
i don 't know
we meet up , the sex is good , we laugh ... what else can i say ?
everything all right ?
fantastic
don 't forget to do some work , will you ?
i thought you and i had a future together
but you didn 't , so that was that
djibril ?
gilou . i need to see you
now isn 't a good time
come on , it won 't take long
have i ever let you down ?
ok . where are you ?
i knew we were mates
what 's this car ?
who cares ?
just help me shift it
why the hell should i help you ?
how many cars did i get for your mates ?
the crime unit is after you !
can 't you get me off ?
get you off ? you must be joking ok .
then i 'll say your mates helped me to find those cayennes
i 'll break your face , you piece of shit
- piece of shit ?
- yeah
i do you a favour and you won 't lift a finger to help me ?
you said we had to trust each other
i had some news , but maybe i won 't tell you
tell me what ?
tell me what ?
you 're rumbled , you prick
the judge has a file on you
happy now ?
don 't move , sweetheart . just wait
ok .
now , you do the same
it 's too tight
wait , did you pack your scissors ?
try cutting it
you 're bleeding
don 't worry
is it working ?
shit , you did it !
do that again and i 'll break your legs , got it ?
you disgust me
i disgust you ?
you didn 't mind it in prison
- croissants
- any danish pastries ?

here it comes
it 'll be ok
hello ?
- is that charlotte 's mum ?
- yes .
can i talk to her ?
do you have the money ?
- yes , but my daughter ...
- how much ?
- 100000
- have you told the police ? no

- ok
- jp , nico , wait at the station
- copy that

we can 't afford to fail , laure
- goodbye .
thank you very much - thanks
i got your message . i know what you 're going to ask
- i 'd rather not repeat myself
- me neither . my answer hasn 't changed
- i 'm dismissing the case - excuse me ?
i made an error of judgment
the evidence led me to believe jaulin was guilty , but i was wrong
sometimes , judges make mistakes
your enemies will have a field day
well , good for them
but soon , jaulin will no longer be accused of killing his family ... and no one can stop his son from visiting him ... not even you
see how much your mum loves you ?
you see how much you 're worth to her ? that bitch has abandoned you
her mum would never do that .
she loves her
- then she should have paid up
- she cares , unlike your mum
- bitch
- what did you say ?
shut your fucking mouth
what 's wrong with her ?
what is it ?
what 's wrong with the girl ?
she needs her inhaler .
it 's in her bag
give her the inhaler
film her
all right , little man ?
how i 've missed you !
get her some water , please
laure

chief inspector berthaud

i 'm not listening

look in charlotte 's bag and get her inhaler i know you can do that .
ok ?
then , i 'll bring the money . i promise
that kid means nothing to me if she dies , it 'll be your fault
this is all your fault
you told me not to pay
that 's why we 're in this mess
where 's her bag ?
you want to help with her homework ?
where is it ?
- in the van - go and get it
go and get it . hurry up

- do you have papers for that ?
- yes , of course
what am i charged with , again ?
i want everything accounts , in voices , social security payments ...
- hello
- joséphine , we were waiting for you
please , sit down
this is a surprise
now we 're all here , i suggest we get started
the first item is the inclusion of our colleague joséphine karlsson ... on the firm 's board of directors
we all know the crucial role she had in getting ziani released ... and how deftly she took advantage of the justice system ... to help get our firm back on track
any objections ?
any abstentions ?
then welcome aboard , my dear
thank you
now , i 'd like us to add another item to the agenda
since when do we add items at the last minute ?
since when do you care about etiquette ?
i would like to vote on the dismissal of one of our partners ... in other words , you , eric
you want to dismiss me ?
don 't act surprised .
you knew this was on the cards i offered to negotiate several times , and you always refused
you need a unanimous vote to dismiss a partner
who 's in favour of dismissing eric edelman ... from the firm 's board of directors ?
if you thought i was expensive , you haven 't seen anything yet
recognise yourself ?
what 's the problem ?
i can use a car park if i want
and this ?
what ?
you 're driving a cayenne
don 't make me laugh
you can 't even see who that is
do you have a photo of me nicking it ?
you have a passkey to break into cayennes
we saw you with it
without my face behind the wheel , you 've got nothing
i wouldn 't relax just yet
because we 're not giving up
get him to sign his statement
you fucked us over , didn 't you ?
but i know who 's fucking your girlfriend even harder
gilou , it 's me , cindy
i wanted to tell you . i can 't stop thinking about yesterday
i loved it .
i want you to take me
we were tricked . your honour the cars had gone from the garage
we 've nothing on mérini , so we can 't keep him in
why were the cars gone ?
did mérini know you were coming ?
possibly
you never know with informants
mérini 's an informant ?
for whom ?
for inspector berthaud .
i thought you knew
your honour ?
hello ?
i 'll be back in a sec
yes , cindy ?
djibrll knows about us . he 's furious .
he says he 's going to kill me
shit . where are you ?
roxanne 's . but he knows the address
lock the door . i 'm coming
- ok
- ok
tintin , i 'll be back .
call me if you hear anything
- your honour
- superintendent
your honour , we 're waiting for oz to call
haven 't you traced her phone ?
yes , but she never calls from the same place and then she turns it off
thanks for coming . will you sit down ?
can i talk to you ?
yes
you and i have always trusted one another , haven 't we ?
yes
why didn 't you tell me mérini was your informant ?
you might have mentioned it
i didn 't tell you because ... it wasn 't important
who warned him about the search ?
no one knew except you
anyone can betray me , laure ... except you
berthaud
hello ?
listen up , you bastards take the money where i tell you and then get lost
if you arrest me , you 'll never see charlotte again
understand ?
ok , but i need guarantees .
how 's charlotte doing ? fine
did you give her the inhaler ?
yeah
i knew you would .
i trusted you , oz
i 'd like you to bring her with you , so we can make the swap
do you think i 'm stupid ?
i don 't trust your friends , but i trust you
so bring charlotte ...
stop fucking talking and listen
you 'll leave the money at a bus stop in draveil . rue copernic
if you arrest me , you know what happens
copernic . ok
wait . let me hand you over to someone
karen , it 's me
it 's mum

then duke alexis , my uncle , came . "
" my mother was broken-hearted and he became the master of the house . "
" one night i heard an anguished cry echoing . "
i tried everything , but it was in vain !
it was as if she were mad and would not listen to my accusations . "
" i also fell into a strange kind of lethargy , but it did not dim my conscience . "
" when i recovered my senses , after many hours , we were already far away . "
" a poor fisherman took pity on me and hid me . "
" but the villains would not give up .
they still waited and , the other evening , i managed to escape them . "

any 35 mm . cut of this film seems to be lost nowadays .
manuel peña rodríguez preserved one copy , which was given in the late 60 's to the national arts fund . in 1971 , technician fernando vigévano made a 16 mm . internegative from that 35 mm .
copy , which was later destroyed . that internegative is currently preserved by the national film museum , and it was used for this edition .
the screening speed was adjusted , the colour tones were improved , also , some intertitles , formerly unreadable due to poor contrast , were also restored .
even after my death
the city of silence , where pride and ambition shudder .
shadows and memories sleep under the peaceful cypresses .
in each gravestone , a story , a name , a date ...
if only the most private tragedies of those standing by the graves could be read , too !
here lies elvira meró may she rest in peace .
that morning , a man and a child were standing by a humble grave . what a sad memories they seemed to be evoking !
the man was mature . his features and manners revealed his distinguished origins , also the passing of time and the effects of thoughts .
the child was a spring-like portrait of the man .
a string of reminiscence stroke the man 's spirit .
in just a few minutes
his tortured mind went through twelve years of memories .

- that wasn 't our dad .

at night , back at the guesthouse .
luis was able to quench his thirst and hunger at a friend 's table . then he met elvira after work .
- our family sent us money .
elvira decides to go further .
days later ... the self-sacrificing instinct , most important virtue in a woman , keeps both students under elvira 's determined protection .
- do you remember this ?
- haven 't your families sent you money again ?
- it 's late .
we 'll walk you home .
the good elvira walks with them to the university . she makes sure that they actually attend their classes .

months later , this friendship between master and disciple makes luis a frequent companion at the doctor 's elegant table .
meanwhile , at the humble guesthouse , elvira gets luis ' clothes ready .
luis ,
i waited for you until 11 : 00 p . m. , when garramuño sent me to bed .
what a long dinner !
were you thinking of me while eating ?
l left two shirts and six pairs of socks ready for you .
the evening goes on in the luxurious living room . the aristocratic girl , not the orphan
- congratulate me . l found a bride with a million pesos dowry .
- elvira was waiting for you . - seeing that you didn 't arrive , she left this note .
the alcohol and the devil are the enemies of good actions .
the alcohol and the typical foolishness of a 20-years-old make luis conceive a strange criminal idea .
the sleep always stands by the good people , and fell upon this kind soul like a gentle caress .
- what 's all this ?
- you 're not worthy of her kind actions , - or my friendship .
- you 're so ungrateful !
tell her you 're sorry !
- young people get confused .
- one has to be careful , my child .
- rude boys always get through the first open door they find .
- what an abusing young man !
- l never thought he might do something like this !
doctor ximénez pays attention to his daughter 's subjective pleading .
- please invite luis to my birthday .
he 's a really fun guy !

dear elvira ,
i 'll have no money for some few days , and i got myself into debt while fulfilling my student duties . l implore you to provide me with 500 pesos , please .
oh !
a kind cashier like you won 't say no !
the bearer of this letter will receive the money .
thank you .
- l assure you ! she took money from the safe ! see it for yourself .
- with whose permission
did you get money from the safe ?
- you cheated my sister so lowly !
- forgive me , sir !
her face burned in shame , her soul was tortured by sorrow . the unhappy woman returned to the guesthouse .
- l have a terrible headache .
she unburdened herself from her sorrow and shame with good old garramuño .
- we must return that money .
an accusation would be terrible !
- we must help her . she 's a good lady . we all make mistakes .
- l bring you the money .
please , sign this bill for me .
- this will teach you to be a man , not a villain !
the emotions of such a stressful day make delicate elvira fall ill .
unaware of all the damage he caused ,
luis returns to the guesthouse .
- l 'm so ashamed !
- don 't be . l 'll graduate soon , and then we 'll get married .
- the man who abuses of a naïve , self-sacrificed woman is not a man ! it 's a cynic !
this violent rupture with his friend obliges garramuño to change rooms
there he goes with his things .
in his blind ambition , luis only cares about that gift he bought at someone else 's expenses .
- l feel ill .
please , fetch luis .
the triumph of evil .
- this dose is excessive .
who prescribed this ?
- a medicine student .
the tragedy seemed to threaten the house that night , and the night unleashed its own mysteries .
cured .
cleaning his friend 's messy room ,
elvira discovers a terrible secret .
the sinister idea of death , perhaps a comforting idea in such unfortunate days , came to the mind of this impulsive poor soul .
luis , fate does us apart .
l wish you can be happy with the woman you love , the woman you abandoned me for . good bye forever .
elvira .
at the same time , that other woman prepares herself for a happy night . she doesn 't know that she 's a rival .
anticipating his triumph , the drunk , frivolous student dresses up for such a joyful party .
dear garramuño , luis doesn 't love me anymore .
l now know that he even made a thief of me to give another woman a gift .
my only wish was to live for him and with him . given his love for another woman , my only destiny should be death .
my good and loyal friend , this is my final farewell .
elvira .
garramuño goes to the police .
l recommend the retention of miss elvira meró , argentinean , 21 years old , regular height , thin , white , blond , blue eyes .
meanwhile ...
i recommend the retention of miss elvira meró , argentinean , 21 years old , regular height , thin , white , blond , blue eyes .
the commissar .
- look for her at the palermo woods .
- no news ?
miss elvira meró was arrested by agent ivaldi at 23 : 30 hours , when she tried to throw herself to the train .
few months later .
recommended by garramuño ,
elvira becomes the governess of a distinguished house .
but soon ...
my dear friend , why did you ruin my comforting resolution of that day ?
the outcome i feared the most is now becoming true .
l 'm having a child and i 'm getting fired !
help me , for god 's sake !
elvira .
the engagement .
times have changed ...
the girls were ashamed of boys before , but not now .
only in public charity that poor good soul finds help .
reserve an anatomic bed for me , i have an examination tomorrow .
- she 's in god 's hands .
one more , life and death meet face to face .
next day . - she wanted me to ask you to look after her child . - the fact of trusting you
- do you know who is she ?
no , not you !
- look what you did !
she donated her body to him , and by being good even after her death , she won his heart definitely .
noticing that he destroyed his life and career driven by madness , and that his behave will make him loose prestige among friends and relatives , the new surgeon decides to pay for his actions and exiles himself .
he sets course to the unknown .
the loyal garramuño satisfies poor elvira 's last wish .
'look after the child ' , commanded him both the dead woman and his own kindness .
and there he was , a complete father , as gentle to the child as a mother could be .
- don 't cry , little boy .
- tears should not turn into sorrow the joyful dawn of your life , - nor frighten your happiness away , - as mine was when your mother felt in love with another man .
the evocation is over now .
that man was dr. luis rodriguez , who had come back from exile . and his child , now grown up and educated by dr. garramuño .
they visited the grave of their beloved woman and pulled the petals off the eternal flowers of memory .

" no , douglas , you had better give up scenario writing and stick to acting . "
in 2004 a tinted nitrate print of terje vigen was rediscovered .
from this print a black and white duplicate negative was made in 2005 .
the film 's original intertitles were inserted into the new negative , and the colours were recreated by the desmet tinting method .
act one .
there lived a remarkably grizzled man on the uttermost , barren isle ;
he never harmed , in the wide world 's span , a soul by deceit or guile ;
his eyes , though , sometimes would blaze and fret most when the storm was nigh , -
and now , all i 've heard about terje i 'll try to tell from the first to last .
with land underfoot he was never at ease ; no , better by far then to dwell on the seas , on the mighty ebb and the flow .
in autumn , when wild-geese were singing south , he met with their flying skein .
a heaviness fell on the sailor 's breast ;
life lay astern with fire and zest , and ahead lay a winter 's gloom .
they anchored , and off his crewmen went with leave for a wild carouse .
he watched them with envy and discontent while he stood by his silent house .
indoors there were two bestowed ;
his wife sat and span in the peaceful light , but the crib held a rosy , healthy mite , a baby girl , and it crowed .
that instant , and terje 's mind , men say , turned sober upon the spot .
he would sing all his happiest ditties there , where little anna tugged his brown hair and lay in his folding arm .
life ambled along till the year of war in eighteen-hundred and nine .
the tale 's still told of what people bore , where want and distress combine .
cruisers from england blockaded each port , by land there was dearth far and wide ;
the poor people starved , the wealthy went short ,
two powerful arms were no longer support with death and disease outside ,
then terje drooped for a day or two
but his miseries quickly go ;
he thought of a comrade , ancient and true : the sea 's great ebb and its flow .
the smallest dory there was to hand he chose for his skagen trip .
sail and mast he left home on land , such gear he thought best not ship .
" when winds stopped blustering quite so wild , -
- terje vigen rowed for his wife and child crossed the sea in an open boat ! "
the jutland reef was the devil to clear , but worse , he 'd the english blockade to fear its look-out 's eagle-eyed gleam .
to be continued .
act two .
at fladstrand , reaching there safe and sound , he gathered his precious stores .
here was the staff of life to hand ; and his wife and baby call .
the fourth morning , at dawn , by sun 's first rays , a blurred , misty line to scan .
near home at last ; -
that instant the word froze on his lip ;
gæsling 's the shoal with hidden top just east of the homborg sound ;
the english officer shouted " stop ! " he hoisted an oarbutt , let it drop , and stove in the dory 's shell .
" there on the innermost beach ashore watches my wife at our pitiful door and waits with our baby for bread ! "
he dived and he swam and he dived yet again ;
in two feet depth all that treasure sank .
they lifted him out and over the side
he offered his sorrow , they sold him their glee
then terje fell silent , all hope was past , he locked up his grief in his soul .
he languished in prison for many a day , for all of five years , say some
his shoulders rounded , his hair it turned grey from dreaming about his home .
then eighteen-fourteen came and with it accord ;
a swedish frigate brought home onboard - - norway 's prisoners , and terje too .
back at the jetty he came ashore a pilot by king 's decree ;
but few recalled in the greybeard they saw , the youngster who braved the sea .
his house was a stranger 's ; and how they fared those two , inside he soon found :
" the husband forsook them , and nobody cared , they came to the plot that the paupers shared , in the parish burial-ground . "
to be continued .
act three .
years went by , and he kept to his trade as pilot out there on the isle
his eyes , though , sometimes would blaze and fret , when the reef to the breakers ran high ,
and then people sensed he was troubled yet , and then there were few who felt no threat with terje vigen by .
one moonlit night , with onshore wind , there was a stir where the pilots sit
an english yacht being carried in with mainsail torn and jib split .
close-reached to the weather , a cutter sped
like a hero he seized on the wheel ;
" preserve us alive from the breakers ' roar , l 'll make you as wealthy as wretched before . "
the pilot let go of the craft .
his cheeks they went white , and his mouth shaped a sound , like a smile that at last can break free .
the yacht was broached and ran squarely aground , his lordship 's queen of the sea .
" abandon the ship !
to the boats , i say ! "
" my lord and my lady , stay near ! "
to ieeward he glanced at gæslingen 's top , and to windward at hesnes ' swell .
he let go helm and the foresail strop , he hoisted an oarbutt and let it drop , and stove in the cutter 's shell !
" anna , my child ! " she cried out in dread
to be continued .
act four .
they grounded and sank , but calmness itself inshore of the arc of rough seas
... " there 'snocausefor grief ! " " a sunken dory supplies our relief , three barleygrain casks our dock . "
he knew , now , the sailor that on his knee had crouched on his deck and wept !
" you sailed at ease in your mighty corvette , -
- i rowed in my humble boat . "
" i toiled for my own in my forehead 's sweat , you robbed them of bread , and could mock me yet and over my salt tears gloat . "
" it 's time for my vengeance to strike , beware ! "
" stand back there , my lord !
one step if you dare , and your wife and child is the price ! "
but terje 's forehead showed peaceful and fair .
" and now terje vigen 's himself again . "
" like a rocky stream flowed my blood till then ; for i had to - i had to repay ! "
" the years i spent in the prison 's roar , they bred my heart 's sickliness . "
" but now it 's over ;
we two are even . "
when daylight had broken , then all was well ; long lay the yacht in port .
one day milord and lady came by .
" no , rescue came in the nick out there from this little mite by me . "
the yacht then headed for hesnes-sound , - - with norway 's own flag for wear . he lay to the sun and the winds ' keen weight , and that 's why the grass was so stubborn-straight , but with wild field-flowers between .
the end
in 1956 , fernando birri and the santa fe documentary school rescued " the last indian raid " from oblivion . a 35 mm copy , provided by alcides greca 's family , was screened then .
in 1968 , rosario 's film society rendered it into a 16 mm copy . the technician fernando vigévano was in charge of the project .
since the 35 mm copy is considered lost , the new restored cut had to be made from the 16 mm version preserved by the museo del cine .
according to film society member alfredo scaglia , and historian jorge miguel couselo , the original cut had several colour tones , something usual in those days .
those colour tones were lost during the 16 mm rendering , in which only b / w film was used . in order to restore that ,
cousuelo 's notes were checked , and also the testimonies of film society member octavio fabiano , who was able to observe the original film .
intertitles extension was also improved . in the 16 mm version , intertitles extension had been distorted because vigévano had to copy almost all intertitles from stills , choosing the most clearer ones .
some texts , formerly unreadable due to poor contrast were also restored . a new title was made , inspired in the original design , and a likely correct speed for projection was estimated .
the last indain raid by dr alcides greca
prologue civilization and the indian
in 1904 the aboriginal community of san javier , santa fe , after being in touch with " civilization " for half a century , rose up against the white population , thus threatening the lives of the inhabitants of that blossoming town .
a beautiful town called san javier in argentina , became better known after this event .
the newspapers widely reported the sad events that took place there .

seriousness of the events
dr alcides greca , born in san javier , author of this historical reconstruction , was a representative of his town in government congress .
it won 't be the sick poetry imported from paris , nor the pulp fiction , nor the romance .
it will be the story of a strong and heroic american tribe , which spread legends through the chaco jungle ... alcides .
mr. fernando centeno , governor of chaco ,
former deputy dr ferrarotti and dr greca , debate about the script of this film .
mr centeno thinks that
the last indian raid was still to come .

china petrona and her progeny .
the tribe 's old chief , mariano lopez
the rebel chief , salvador lopez , leader of the 1904 insurrection .
" don " desiderio balcaza , the tribe 's " coplero " ( poet ) . he , like don quixote , rides a skinny horse .
juan saldón , a crazy toba aborigine who does a forward roll , howls like the fox and cries like the " chajá " ( southern screamer ) .
the mocovi , ancient owners of that land , were expropriated . they fish " sábalo " ( prochilodus platensis ) using a " fija , " a kind of harpoon made of tacuara and a piece of iron or hard wood .
they use modern weapons for hunting macaws , maguari storks and wild ducks that inhabit the nearby lagoons .
they use " bolas " for hunting ostrich , a highly profitable activity given its tasty meat .
they hunt caiman , a dangerous animal that lives in water habitats such as lagoons and streams .
they use a thick fishing line , a spear and meat . the caiman eat the meat through the night .
the mocovi are farmhands in the local ranches of san javier .
moving away .
roping
cutting
taming
" latagá " ( cane ) is the mocovi 's worse enemy . they get drunk at the local " pulperías " ( tavern ) .
the white people pushed them to drink .
now they punish them and even take them to jail for drinking .
while the mocovi were living in misery , the tribe 's old chief , bernardo lopez , was living like a king in the land that the government had given to him .
rosa paiquí , a beautiful half-breed girl , was his loving companion .
jesus salvador , the old chief 's brother , missed the old days , when he would roam in the woods .
he regretted the day when he and his people were leaded to san javier by a franciscan missionary brother .
who he was secretly in love with .
the tribe 's poor living conditions , the hatred he felt toward his brother and his love for rosa leaded him to dream of becoming the mocovi 's chief .
salvador visits bernardo in order to convince him of taking care of the people .
- bernardo , sleeping all day long ;
our people are hungry . go talk to the police chief and get our land back .
- i won 't make chief benito angry !
jesus ' generosity left a print in rosa 's heart .
salvador !
rosa !
me , i love you so much ! take this necklace , made of caiman and " yarara " teeth .
wear this and you will defeat the white and become chief !
i bless you jesus , our savior !
act ii the conspiracy
salvador summons his younger brothers and the tribe 's " curacas . "
- the reason why i have summoned you is that i am tired of working for the gringos , tired of suffering .
bernardo is not helping the indian .
the gringos have taken our land .
our people are starving .
let 's kick them out !
gringos have lots of arms ,
mausers and winchesters ...
indians only have hunting rifles and spears . we can 't fight them !
- gringos will bring troops from santa fe in order to defeat us . chief benito is mean . he puts us to jailç if we drink " latagá , "
he has forbidden the ball .
the police chief has been taking away our daughters and sisters .
together we can defeat the gringos !
saint francisco javier will protect the mocovi .
the bullets will turn into mud .
the indian will fight using indian weapons .
the gringos will turn into pigs , and the town will be ours .
their women and houses will belong to us !
juan and andrés are cowards , just like chief bernardo .
they fear the gringo .
salvador is not scared .
if salvador becomes the chief and kicks the gringos out , i will be his woman .
you will be chief salvador 's wife , and the gringo 's daughters will be your servants .
the chasquis ( messengers ) were quickly sent to santa rosa and san martín in order to spread the news about the upcoming revolt .
several aboriginal families immigrated to san javier in a two year period . strange ceremonies were held at night ...
each indian swore to be loyal to the mocovi cause and to keep the rebellion a secret . they left an amulet in the chapel , the same they would wear the day of the battle .
those mocovi , who were still loyal to chief bernardo , took care of his affairs .
the tribe 's spies kept a close look on the enemy 's activities the white people from san javier enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle without noticing that a tempest was about to start .
meanwhile , in a hidden corner of the region ,
jesus salvador was proclaimed chief by the tribe notables .
love affaires , balls and religion .
the day of the uprising was approaching and that year the mocovi pushed the boat out to celebrate san javier 's day .
the procession .
the mocovi carry their saint to the church .
the mocovi celebrated through five days and nights . the executed their traditional dances : " sarandí , " " tontoyogo , "
" bravo " and " cielito . "
the fellows took a chance to dance with the ladies .
the dancing partners
those that broke that rule were tied to a pole .
they were bailed out if they paid in money , cigars or alcohol .
the mocovi sang amusing and kind of melancholic tunes , though they were not refined .
- mr. san javier ! mr. san javier !
pray for us , the poor ones ...
us , the poor ones !
turn around again , cenciona valdé .
the turn you have made , you 've made it in reverse .
long live santa rosa !
dance , dance sinforosa .
stomp your feet fellow .
stomp your feet like the chestnut horse does ...
your love affairs are like a yoyo . like a yoyo .
sometimes they improvised for the local tycoons ' amusement .
- mr. pancho troco .
mr. pancho troco .
buy us some gin .
have a drink .
rosa , who had been forbidden to dance by the chief , remained seated among the old ladies , absorbed in sad thoughts .
she rejected many gentlemen that had invited her to dance .
but she couldn 't resist one , who didn 't care about bernardo 's orders .
bernardo sees that his orders were not obeyed .
and forces rosa to comeback home .
- you were dancing with salvador , that thief !
don 't insult him !
i 'll teach you !
the next day , two of bernardo 's men took rosa to a faraway corner in the islands .
rosa was kept in there for several weeks , in exile , thinking about salvador .
ananoque , one of salvador 's loyal helpers , had tracked her down .
every night , while the guardians were asleep , ananoque visited rosa and told her about salvador and his plans .
chief salvador sends this ceibo ( national flower of argentina ) and cochiyo for the day . i 'll keep you up to date .
act iv . the regression
the indians had started to go back to a more primitive stage .
they had moved away a large amount of stolen cattle to the islands .
several farmers were killed in their own land
not even the bullets could hold the hungry of mocovi back .
the land owners and farmers constantly complained to the police chief .
the mocovi , who prefer mare meat over any other kind , would not miss a chance of satisfying their appetite .
many mocovi were arrested for committing such crimes .
this reprisal urged jesús salvador to quickly gather together all his followers .
juan and andrés , salvador brothers , were planning to murder chief bernardo .
bernardo found shelter at the police station .
meanwhile , the people in the town became aware of the imminent danger .
women and children panicked .
april 21st , 10 am . tension between people in town and he indian was growing fast . the battle was about to start .
the sky over san javier turned threateningly black , and a tempest broke in the islands .
rosa hears the ostrich booming . it was the sign she was expecting . the rebellion had just started , and she decides to act .
i 've hurt my hand .
bring some water from the well .
there you go !
so you won 't be cheating on bernardo again ! evil woman !
act v
chief benito reacts to the mocovi attack .
at noon , the mocovi interrupted the communications by cutting the telegraph wire .
the governor of santa fe received the following message .
" thousands of insurgent indians ... "
this telegram and some other alarming rumors reached the capital city through different via . the newspapers reported out the terrible events .
news received from different places confirms mocovi indian uprising in san javier .
town inhabitants were slaughtered . last telegram received at the government says : " thousands of insurgent indians ... "
personnel are assumed dead when going ...
they are attacking the town .
meanwhile in santa fe , rumor had it that the storm hadn 't have started yet in san javier ...
gaucho feliciano luna went to see the mocovi in order to claim the horses they had stolen from him .
hey you , chief of thieves , give back the horses you have stolen from me .
- indian did not steal any horse , old luna .
how dare you !
thief , give back my horses , otherwise i will ...
they are going to kill luna ! fire !
five minutes later .
the town was besieged by the raging mocovi for two hours .
the battle ended . the tribe had been defeated .
san javier 's brave youths went after the fugitives .
the wounded mocoví hid in the rushes and tried to heal their wounds .
that night , in the ranches ... the neighbors set the mocovi campground on fire .
act vi chasing the indian
several groups went out to watch out the surroundings , where the indians had supposedly committed terrible crimes .
the defeated mocovi ran away toward the islands , heading the gran chaco , avoiding the northern towns .
one group of rebels remained standing . commanded by salvador , they had changed their objective . they couldn 't conquer the town , but they would capture bernardo .
the old tribe chief was away from the anger of the mocovi .
the police dismantled the group of rebels . jesús salvador and his loyal ananoque managed to go in san javier in order to reach the islands .
at the sunset , the two mocovi , living symbols of defeat , approach shack where rosa paiquí was kept prisoner .
that poor half-breed girl was still tied to the post .
all of a sudden , an awful scene took place in front of her sad eyes .
salvador !
the loving couple , hiding in the shadows of the night , managed to get rid of their chasers . they were heading gran chaco , the land of the indian , taking unknown routes on their way .
epilogue
once there , in the land of high breakaxes and noble palm trees ,
jesus salvador was the chief of rosa paiquí 's heart .
the restless indian , who fought against civilization , took from it its sweetest legacy :
the kiss , which was unknown to his people .

act 1
at the time when aslaug became a grown-up girl , there was no much rest at night to be had at huseby . ... as the most handsome boys in the village both wrangled and fought night after night .
the nights before sunday were the worst .
thormund , the wealthiest farmer in the village
- hjalmar peters
ola , his son
- kurt welin
courage , my boy !
i have talked to knut huseby , and you will receive a warm welcome .
knut huseby
- theodor blich
aslaug . knut huseby 's daughter - gull cronvall
you don 't seem to succeed much better then the rest of us in pleasing the huseby wolf
sigurd and oivind , huseby 's sons - hugo tranberg and gosta cederlund
since i 've been given a daughter , i 'm obliged to protect her , boys
you are so right , father .
whoever makes his way here will be saluted by me
should we baptize him ?
there you go !
i think you dampened his burning desire .
tore naesset was only a smallholder 's son , but was nevertheless reputed ... to be the one who most frequently visited the huseby farmer 's daughter .
darling , come what may , tomorrow i will speak with your father .
tomorrow i will follow you to huseby and propose in knut 's presence .
on sunday , after tore had escorted his mother home from church ... he set out to address huseby , just like he had promised aslaug . - hilda castegren
no , no , my lad , don 't even think of such haughtiness .
you , a poor smallholder 's son , could never get the daughter at huseby .
i most certainly can , little mum .
it 's plain to see that these two suit each other well .
although the girl is a little shy , of course .
is your father at home ?
you , knut huseby , are a wealthy man , and i myself am no church mouse .
you have many children , and i only have this one son .
what if you gave my son your daughter 's hand in marriage ?
it seems a fair offer , but in this case my daughter will have to make her own decision .
go out and find aslaug , sigurd .
father wants a word with you , aslaug , and he won 't be pleased to know ... that you stand here wasting time with the smallholder boy from nesset , ... when a bloke like ola thormundsen has come to propose to you .
it so happens that aslaug and i have loved each other for a long time .
i have come here to ask for her hand .
if i can 't have tore , i will not spend another happy day in this world
as yet , there is no tradition here on huseby for farmers ' daughters ... to share the marriage bed with smallholders ' sons .
nevertheless , that day is likely to arrive .
the end of act 1
a dangerous proposal act 2
a few days later .
aslaug brought the cattle to the summer pasture .
the next saturday night .
only one road led to the huseby summer farm , and it passed right by the main farm .
would you believe that boy !
he seems to be heading for the mountain farm !
god 's peace on the summer farm !
god 's peace to you too .
it 's just not right that this smallholder stud should be allowed up at the huseby summer farm .
well , if no one else can keep him at bay ... i guess me and my sons should give it a try .
i may still possess some talent in that direction .
come on , boy , let 's have a bout !
enough for today , fiddler !
come back soon , and i 'll give you some more !
don 't forget your fiddle when you come to our wedding .
a lazybone like you will have to accept whatever comes his way .
while aslaug faithfully yearned , tore approached the huseby farm .
if next saturday you manage to slip past the huseby wolf and his cubs , the girl will be yours .
the end of act 2
a dangerous proposal act 3
a few days passed .
since tore visit to the farm , there had been no news from the valley .
what do you want , my lad ?
how do you do up here , aslaug ?
you are probably a bit lonely now that nesset cannot come here anymore ?
yes , he got what he deserve .
we fixed him up so well last saturday night , ... that he 's probably lost all desire to go courting again at the huseby mountain farm .
come next saturday .
tore was fit again , although not in such high spirits as he used to be .
if next saturday you manage to slip past the huseby wolf and his cubs , the girl will be yours .
in the worst case , i 'll get a good beating !
we 're just here to make sure that the smallholder boy from nesset stays away from the summer farm tonight .
yes , we would like to join you .
position yourselves two at every hill .
if he approaches , whistle !
i bet ola would love to go to the mountain farm himself tonight .
the two of us as well .
the girl will finally have to give up ... because the engagement will be broken off tonight .
the boys will stand guard down here .
the end of act 3
a dangerous proposal act 4
it was on a saturday evening . i had been awaiting you .
you promised me to come , but your promise proved untrue .
where could you find a rose where no rose ever grows ?
where can true love be found if your sweetheart lets you down ?
god 's peace on the mountain farm !
god 's peace to you too !
that fellow is worth having .
the girl shall be his .
the shimmering summer air hangs over hardangerfjord .
against the sky in bluish hue the mighty mountains loom .
the glacier shines , the hillsides are green .
the clime is clad in its finest attire .
and behold !
over green , clear waves a bridal procession sails .
